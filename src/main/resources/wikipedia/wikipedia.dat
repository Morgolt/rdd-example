Those supporting deletion successfully establish the lack of significant third-party coverage, yet those supporting keeping the article note the success of the business, while it does not make the subject ''inherently'' notable, contributes to an argument thereof, and some argue that there are sufficient sources for inclusion (e.g., Ktr101).

Several third party sources identify metrics which I wouldn't consider "trivial" or "incidental" as per [[WP:CORP|the notability guidline on corporations]] and could even be considered inherently notable, such as [http://finance.yahoo.com/news/beacon-roofing-acquire-mcclure-johnston-130251881.html;_ylt=A0LEVxM23VhU2OwAbvBXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTEzY2RxajU3BHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDNgRjb2xvA2JmMQR2dGlkA1ZJUDUzMl8x almost $100 in annual sales], [http://www.prosalesmagazine.com/news/distributors/beacon-roofing-supply-opens-location-no-200_o opening over 200 stores, recording almost $2 billion in total sales] and being a large, publicly traded company.

But I was unable to find anything in the article itself or this discussion so far that matched it, and the total there is not sufficient. GraniteSand's sources are warmed-over press releases. That the company is NASDAQ-listed does not in my experience demonstrate the existence of good coverage.  Still, with a $1B+ market cap, I would guess that coverage may still exist, yet to be found, perhaps in specialized industry periodicals. The topic ''may'' be able to show notability if a sufficiently informed editor has access to appropriate sources and builds an article from them.

No exclusion of analyst reports is made, and indeed it is specifically cited as material that conveys notability.  What you consider boring, routine stuff, people interested in business consider exciting.  Business writing normally covers financials (but note most such reports also give background info on what the company does) by people paid to cover financials.  That doesn't make it any less reliable or indepth - the actual notability requirements - nor does it make it indiscriminiate (business analsysts/reports do choose what they write about - no one blindly covers every company in existance!).

Later into the 1900s the Nepalese tea producers acted as suppliers to Darjeeling factories when tea bushes became old and yields decreased.<ref name=mishra/> Orthodox tea now provides a source of sustainability for almost 20 000 farmers in Nepal.<ref name=mishra/> Farmers are supported by the National Tea and Coffee Development Board created by the Nepalese Ministry of Agriculture.<ref name=ntcdb>NTCDB.

There is also that one still has to click on this section editing button, which could be avoided, especially considering the time it takes to load visual editor. So a way to save the changes without leaving visual editor would be most welcome. [[User:Cenarium|Cenarium]] ([[User talk:Cenarium|talk]]) 06:05, 1 December 2014 (UTC)  [[User:Cenarium|Cenarium]], I think that you want the [[WP:keyboard shortcuts#List_of_access_keys|keyboard shortcuts]], which work anywhere on the page.

This link will show you the names of the objects that you want to change:  https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Candy&uselang=qqx  There is no way to skip the invitation to provide an edit summary, and I'm certain that this is a WONTFIX issue with the product manager.

I want to remain in visual editor mode after the save. I make edits, I save my edits without leaving visual editor, I edit again, and so on. It would make editing easier and faster, having to use shortcuts is too much of a hassle and it takes too long for visual editor to load. So I think it's a feature that would be very helpful and appreciated, particularly by experienced users. I would suggest a checkbox "stay in visual editor mode after saving". (I would even suggest to have a "visual editor always on" option in preferences, but only further down the line, when performance will have improved.) :Thanks, I know how to hide in css but not how to change a label, so I'll ask at VPT (and I'll update [[WP:CSS#Tips_and_tricks]]).

Is it not possible yet ? :I was not suggesting skipping the window as a feature request, but as something that 'power' users could do using personal js. I've thought of something better though : :I would strongly suggest to offer an option to have the edit summary window and minor edit checkbox (everything else is superfluous, or should be allowed to be hidden) together with the edit window, as in source editing. I see two possibilities, both could be offered and the user would choose according to their preference (mostly based on abundance of vertical space versus horizontal space on their respective platform). Either right below the visual editor menu toolbar, or in another box on the left side of the window where the navigation bar takes lots of unused space.

When working on an article, editors tend to make several edits in succession rather than a big one for several reasons, the main of those being edit conflicts. This would matter even more in visual editor since resolving conflicts would presumably require wikitext editing, which would defeat the purpose of said visual editor. So there should be a way to save without leaving, the visual editor window should update with the user's edit (and non-conflicting edits by other users). :::I've tried using custom js to reload the visual editor immediately after leaving it, as a script for wikitext editor does, but couldn't get js to work with visual editor, see section below.

Tiki taka is his playing style, one may say that the attacking middle fielder is not much of a dribbler but rather makes it up with accurate short passes that create scoring chances.  As a youth, he played for Set Green Hills academy, park center high school , PSC Soccer Academy and Prairie seeds academy.  Before joining FC Minneapolis Mumbo played with Portugal FC as a middle fielder.  He later on joined the Czechoslovakia side, SK Aritma Praha until when he suffered a fatal knee injury that saw him return to the US in the spring of 2014 to sign a Pro Transition Contract with FC Minneapolis.  "Mumbo is a promising player so full of football and mystery. I just can't wait to see what he's going to become here at FC Minneapolis" Smith said.  Due to his Brazilian playing style, Mumbo has been nick named Daudinho by the FC Minneapolis media, a title that fits him whenever he appears before the ball.  <ref>http://www.fcminneapolis.com/#!duadley-muambo/c1cyt</ref>  <ref>http://www.fcminneapolis.com/#!Will-Moore-and-Chen-Yifu-score-as-FC-Minneapolis-draws-with-Hazzelwood-Park/c11iu/45ED5E78-0594-4A91-B98E-2B99D0D4DDF6</ref></text></page>",

"<page><title>Maglekilde</title><text>[[Image:Maglekilde.JPG|thumb|200px|Maglekilde]] '''Maglekilde''' is the most powerful of several natural springs in [[Roskilde]], [[Denmark]]. It formerly issued water at a rate of some 90,000 litres per hour but has now dropped to 15,000 litres per hour. A wellhouse was built over the spring in 1927. It is now listed.  ==History==  ===Early history=== Extensive deposits of [[travertine]] from Maglekilde were mined and used as a building material before bricks became readily available. Several churches in the Rokilde area were built in travertine from the spring in the 11th and 12th centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/1001fortaellinger/da_DK/maglekilden-i-roskilde|title=Maglekilden I Roskilde|publisher=Kulturstyrelsen|accessdate=11 January 2015|language=Danish}}</ref> This activity resulted in the formation of a pond which was used as a [[mill pond]]. The watermill at the site was called Maglekilde Watermill (''Maglekilde Mølle''). The water from the spring also powered five other watermills on its way to [[Roskilde Fjord]]: Vandhulsmølle, Sankt Mortens Mølle, Kapelsmøllen, Sankt Clara Mølle and Strandmøllen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roskildemuseum.dk/vores-viden/nyere-tid/fredede-huse-i-roskilde-og-lejre.aspx|title=Fredede huse i Roskilde og Lejre|publisher=Roskilde Museum|accessdate=11 January 2015|language=Danish}}</ref> Maglekilde Watermill is first mentioned by name in 1258 but it most likely included in the [[prebendary|prebend]] of one of the [[canon (priest)|canon]]s at the [[cathedral chapter]] in 1253.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roskildehistorie.dk/1200/enkeltaar/1250-99/1253.htm|title=1264|publisher=Roskildes Historie|accessdate=13 January 2015|language=Danish}}</ref>  ===Maglekilde Paper and Textile Mill=== On 8 April 1731, Maglekilde Watermill was the first of the buildings which were destroyed in the series of devastating fires that hit Roskilde in 1731.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roskildehistorie.dk/1700/billeder/bystyre/ildebrande/brand1.htmhtml|title=Brandene I 1731|publisher=Roskildes Historie|accessdate=11 January 2015|language=Danish}}</ref> A new paper mill was built on the site in 1737<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fam-schuwendt.dk/onewebmedia/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20Papirmagerne%20og%20Mundus%20familien.pdf|title=Papirmagerne og Mundus familien.|publisher=fam-schuwendt.dk|accessdate=11 January 2015|language=Danish}}</ref> and it was joined by a textile mill in 1761.

"<page><title>The Coolin</title><text>'''The Coolin''', or The Coolun, is an Irish air often characterised as one of the most beautiful in the [[Irish traditional music|traditional repertoire]].  In Irish, its name has been given as  ''An Chúileann'' or ''An Chúilfhionn'' ("the fair haired girl" or "the fair lady") depending on the text used. The tune is also known as "The Lady of the Desert".  ==History==  The air, and the texts fitted to it, have a long and very complex history. Its exact provenance is unknown, but it has been variously asserted by different authors as dating from the 13th century, from the time of [[Henry VIII]], or from the 17th century, though the latter is the most credible.<ref name=donnellan1112>Donnellan, L. "Traditional Irish and Highland Airs", in Quinn (ed.), ''Journal of the County Louth Archaeological Society'', vol 3, no. 1 (1912), 11-12</ref> There are at least two main Irish language texts and a number of later English translations, or interpretations of both; there are also English words (such as those by [[Thomas Moore|Moore]]) which are not a translation of either Irish version.  ===The air===  The air itself is sometimes claimed to have been composed by [[Turlough O'Carolan|Carolan]], though John Glen (1900) said that the "ancient Irish melody" was in fact usually known as "Molly St George" at the beginning of the 18th century.<ref name=glen218>Glen, J. ''Early Scottish melodies: including examples from mss. and early printed works'', AMS, 1900, p.218</ref> The latter-named tune has been often been associated with the great 17th-century harper [[Thomas Connellan]]. Connellan was also cited alongside Carolan as a possible composer of The Coolin, but as Glen noted, many supposed "that the tune is older than either of them".<ref name="glen218"/>  The version of The Coolin printed by [[Edward Bunting]] in ''The Ancient Music of Ireland '' (1840) was taken from the playing of [[Donnchadh Ó Hámsaigh]] (Dennis Hempson), who himself claimed to have learned it from the playing of [[Cornelius Lyons]] early in the previous century. Though Bunting's setting claims to present the tune with variations, it in fact appears to print only Lyons' once-fashionable baroque variations while omitting the main tune.<ref name=jifss>''Journal of the Irish folk Song Society'', v1-2, Wm. Dawson, 1967, p.32</ref> [[Patrick Weston Joyce]], who said that Bunting's version was "wanting in simplicity", printed a version of the tune collected from the playing of a fiddler, Hugh O'Beirne, that he said was very similar to that he recalled being sung in his youth in 1830s [[County Limerick]].<ref name=joyce299>Joyce, ''Old Irish Folk Music and Songs'', 1909, p.299</ref>  Other versions appeared in several late 18th century collections, as well as in the 1795 opera ''The Wicklow Mountains'', written by [[John O'Keeffe (Irish writer)|John O'Keeffe]] with music by [[William Shield]].  ===Claimed 13th or 16th century origins===  These suggestions originated with [[Joseph Cooper Walker]], who said in his ''Historical Memoirs of the Irish Bards'' (1786) that the air's title in fact referred to what he called the "coulins", or long locks of hair, worn by Irish men and which were prohibited by a statute of [[Henry VIII]], although he noted that no actual words to the air on this subject had survived.<ref name=walker134>Walker, J. C. ''Historical Memoirs of the Irish Bards'', Payne, 1786, p.134</ref> Despite the lack of a text, Walker's assertion was repeated by, amongst others, [[Laurence F. Renehan|Renehan]] and [[W. H. Grattan Flood]]: Flood however proposed (based on a suggestion by Lynch in a letter to the ''Dublin Penny Journal'') the air must refer to an earlier statute of the 13th century. The story inspired a 19th-century patriotic poem called ''The Coulin Forbidden'', written by W. B. McBurney under the pseudonym "Carroll Malone".  [[File:Eugene OCurry-Social England 1904-p889-with-header.jpg|thumbnail|right|The distinguished philologist [[Eugene O'Curry]] believed that the air known as The Coolin was first given that name in the early 18th century by a Fr. Oliver O'Hanley.]]  The philologist [[Eugene O'Curry]] asserted, however, that the title "The Coolin" was only applied to the air in the 18th century after it was used by a priest, Fr. Oliver O'Hanley, to set a poem he wrote in praise of a famous beauty of [[County Limerick]].<ref name=griffin>O'Curry, E. Note XXVI to Griffin, G. ''The Invasion'', 1895, p.586</ref> In this case, O'Curry commented, the word "Coolin" is used in its sense "fair-haired one", to refer to a girl: he disagrees with Walker, stating "no such word was ever, or ever could have been, applied to the ''glibbs'', or long tufts of back hair, prohibited by old English statute".<ref name="griffin"/>  The Rev. L. Donnellan, in a survey of the various texts and tunes of The Coolin, published in the 1912 ''Journal of the County Louth Archaeological Society'', was equally dismissive: he states that Walker's "credulous" story of it referring to an English statute was "fabricated by his friend [William] Beauford".<ref name=donnellan1112>Donnellan, L. "Traditional Irish and Highland Airs", in Quinn (ed.), ''Journal of the County Louth Archaeological Society'', vol 3, no. 1 (1912), 11-12</ref> He also notes that what he called Walker's "foolish speculation" was encouraged by his insertion of the phrase "glibbs and coulins" into the 16th century statute, which he notes only refers to proscribed "glibbs".<ref name="donnellan1112"/> Donnellan's conclusion was that the original composition was a 17th-century one attributed to O Duagain (see below).  ===Text attributed to O Duagain===  The oldest and best-known Irish text definitely associated with the tune is a love-poem addressed to a fair-haired girl (''chúilfhionn''); this is attributed to a poet called Muiris O Duagain or Maurice O'Dugan of [[Benburb]] and said to have been written in around 1641.<ref name=hardiman>Hardiman, James. ''Irish minstrelsy, or Bardic remains of Ireland'', v.1, 1831, p.349</ref> English translations of this text have been written by Sir [[Samuel Ferguson]] (beginning "O have you seen the Coolun") and [[Thomas Furlong (poet)|Thomas Furlong]], amongst others. The latter was printed by [[James Hardiman]], along with O Duagain's original text, in his collection ''Irish Minstrelsy'' (1831).  A version of O Duagain of Benburb's poem was also printed, with translations, in [[Douglas Hyde]]'s ''Love Songs of Connacht'' (1893), with the first line ''A's éirigh do shuidhe a bhuachaill a's gleus dam mo ghearrán'' ("And rise up lad, and get ready for me my nag"). Hyde omits two stanzas already printed by Hardiman, and describes this as a version collected in [[Connacht]].<ref name=hyde>Hyde, ''Love Songs of Connacht'', 1893, pp.69-70</ref>  Donnellan, after dismissing Walker, Grattan Flood and O'Curry's other suggestions, states that the probability "is that O'Dugan of Benburb did compose a poem with this air perhaps substantially the same as the different versions given by Hardiman, Vol. I., p. 251 ; O'Daly, p. 155 ; and Dr. Hyde, pp. 70-73 in the ''Love Songs of Connacht''".<ref name="donnellan1112"/>   ===Text attributed to O'Hanley===  Writing in the early 1800s, O'Curry said that the title "The Coolin" was first applied to the air in the 18th century after it was used by a poet, Father Oliver O'Hanley (fl. 1700-1750), to set an Irish-language poem he had written in praise of Nelly O'Grady, a celebrated beauty of [[County Limerick]].<ref name="griffin"/> This text, beginning ''Ceó meala lá seaca, ar choilltibh dubha baraighe'' ("A honey mist on a day of frost, in a dark oak wood"), and which is addressed to ''Neilidh'' ("Nelly") was printed by Hyde, who said it was written in a manuscript originating in [[County Clare]], though the manuscript was partly damaged and he could not read two stanzas.<ref name="hyde"/>  ===Other texts===  Hyde noted the existence of what he called a Munster version of the poem, given in O'Daly's ''The poets and poetry of Munster'' (1850).<ref name="hyde"/> This shares some material with that attributed to O Duagain, but is only three stanzas long and includes a reference to a member of the Power family.<ref name=odaly>O'Daly, J. ''The Poets and Poetry of Munster: A Selection of Irish Songs by the Poets of the Last Century'', 1850, pp.124-125</ref>  Another well-known text was written for the air in English by the poet [[Thomas Moore]], usually known by its first line ''Though the last glimpse of Erin''. It is not a translation of any of the earlier Irish versions. Donnellan noted that the version of the air used by Moore was substantially "correct and unaltered", particularly in comparison to Bunting's, when compared with early 19th and late 18th century copies of the tune, though it still showed some evidence of having been adapted by an "instrumentalist".<ref name=donnellan12>Donnellan, 12, 13</ref>  ==Text==  The following is the early 19th century translation of O Duagain's text by Ferguson:  :O have you seen the Coolun, :Walking down the cuckoo's street, :With the dew of the meadow shining :On her milk-white twinkling feet! :My love she is, and my ''coleen oge'', :And she dwells in Bal'nagar; :And she bears the palm of beauty bright, :From the fairest that in Erin are.  :In Bal'nagar is the Coolun :Like the berry on the bough her cheek; :Bright beauty dwells for ever :On her fair neck and ringlets sleek; :Oh, sweeter is her mouth's soft music :Than the lark or thrush at dawn, :Or the blackbird in the greenwood singing :Farewell to the setting sun.  :Rise up, my boy! make ready :My horse, for I forth would ride, :To follow the modest damsel, :Where she walks on the green hillside; :Where since our youth were we plighted, :In faith, troth, and wedlock true - :She is sweeter to me nine times over, :Than organ or cuckoo!  :For, ever since my childhood :I loved the fair and darling child; :But our people came between us, :And with lucre our pure love defiled; :Ah, my woe it is, and my bitter pain, :And I weep it night and day, :That the ''coleen bawn'' of my early love, :Is torn from my heart away.  :Sweetheart and faithful treasure, :Be constant still and true; :Nor for want of herds and houses :Leave one who would ne'er leave you, :I'll pledge you the blessed Bible, :Without and eke within, :That the faithful God will provide for us, :Without thanks to kith or kin.   :Oh, love, do you remember :When we lay all night alone, :Beneath the ash in the winter storm :When the oak wood round did groan? :No shelter then from the blast had we, :The bitter blast or sleet, :But your gown to wrap about our heads, :And my coat around our feet.<ref name=ferguson>''The Book of Irish Ballads: Edited by Denis Florence M'Carthy'', James Duffy, 1846, p.188</ref>  ==Historic performances==  The Coolin was a popular part of the Irish harp repertoire of the 18th century. [[Charles Fanning (harper)|Charles Fanning]] won first prize at the [[Belfast Harp Festival]] of 1792 with a performance of The Coolin, repeating his success at the earlier [[Granard]] harp festivals with the same tune.<ref name=aoneill>[http://billhaneman.ie/AIH/MemoirsOfArthurONeill.html The Memoirs of Arthur O'Neill], Chapter XVI</ref> Bunting appears to have disapproved of Fanning's performance at Belfast, noting that he "was not the best performer, but he succeeded in getting the first prize by playing 'The Coolin' with modern variations, a piece of music at the time much in request by young practitioners on the piano-forte".<ref name=oneill>Bunting, quoted in O'Neill, F. ''Irish Minstrels and Musicians'', 1913, p.84</ref>  After the decline of Irish harping in the early 19th century, the air became equally popular as an instrumental piece with fiddle players and [[uilleann pipes|pipers]]. Recordings of The Coolin exist by [[Leo Rowsome]], [[Johnny Doran]] and [[Willie Clancy (musician)|Willie Clancy]], amongst others.  ==Samuel Barber setting==  The composer [[Samuel Barber]] published a setting of The Coolin in 1942 for unaccompanied chorus, based on a text originally published by [[James Stephens (author)|James Stephens]] in the collection ''Reincarnations''.<ref name=heyman182>Heyman, B. ''Samuel Barber'', OUP, 1992, p.182</ref> Stephens said that his poem, "The Coolun", was based on another by "[[Antoine Ó Raifteiri|Raftery]]",<ref name=stephens>Stephens, ''Reincarnations'', Macmillan, 1918</ref> but seems to bear some similarity to parts of the O'Hanley text ''Ceó meala lá seaca, ar choilltibh dubha baraighe''.  ==References==  {{reflist}}  [[Category:Irish songs]] [[Category:Year of song unknown]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Coolin}}</text></page>",

"<page><title>Camaldolese Church, Warsaw</title><text>'''Camaldolese Church''', dating from the 17th-18th centuries and situated among the buildings of the hermitage in the Bielański Forest, is one of the most beautiful baroque churches in [[Warsaw]].  [[File:Church of Camaldoleses in Warsaw.JPG|thumb|Camaldolese Church, Warsaw]] <big>'''History'''</big>  The king of Poland [[Władysław IV Vasa]] (Polish: Władysław IV Waza) founded the first church in Bielański Forest as a vote of gratitude for royal election the crown and wining in the Smolensk campaign. The church had to be situated in a remote area according to the [[Camaldolese]]s tradition and it was built on the area of former village Pólko (now Bielany). In 1669-1710 and 1733-1755 the church was rebuilt, the founders of the project were Polish kings [[John II Casimir Vasa|John II Casimir]] (Polish: Jan II Kazimierz Waza) and [[Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki|Michael I]] (Polish: Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki).  During the 19th century Poland was under partitions. After the fall of the [[January Uprising]] in 1864, Tsarist occupation authorities liquidated all Camaldoles monasteries with the exception of the Warsaw. In the next years Russian authorities took over some of the buildings. The Russian introduced a ban on the admission of new members. After that the church and hermitages were taken over by the Russian Red Cross.  In 1905 there was created a parish and the church was renovated. After Russians withdrawal from Warsaw in 1914 there was form an orphanage run by Sisters. In 1916 seminar was launched and in 1918 there was created junior high school. For the purposes it was erected a new building placed in the former foresterium. Nowadays the church and the hermitage huts are preserved in original state. After the destructions of the 2nd World War and burning down of the gymnasium building the former monastery buildings were redesigned by the ATK (Catholic Theology Academy), now UKSW (Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University), and in the site of the hostelry and the remnants of the gymnasium building there is a modern seminary building being erected by the Warsaw Archdiocese.  <big>'''Architecture'''</big><br /> [[File:Plan of the Church of Camaldoleses in Warsaw.jpg|thumb|Plan of the Camaldolese Church, Warsaw]]  Standing in front of the facade of the church we are exactly on the axis of the monastic complex. It is point out by the wooden cross standing at today Dewajtis street. From the setting of that cross in 1693 began to pave the grounds of the monastery. The monastery complex consists of a gate, church, 13 hermitages and foresterium. According to Mariusz Karpowicz the church was designed by Italian architect Isidoro Affaitati.  '''''Facade'''''  Facade was erected when the church with the main body had been already built. Designer of that late Baroque works could be a Roman architect [[Gaetano Chiaveri]]. The facade is triaxle - the central part is a little forward of and topped with a tympanum, enclosed in a pair of composite pilasters and columns. We can observe here two architectural styles late Baroque and early Classicism. The first of them we can see in the details and the second one in the central part and columns. In the side niches are set two wooden polychrome sculptures. The first shows [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict]] and the second one [[Romuald|Saint Romuald]].  '''''Interior'''''  Interior decorations are in rococo style. the church has an octagonal plan cut by cross. Presbytery is a double span, closed semicircular. There is an octagonal nave, which cut transept by transverse axis. The transept is made by two symmetrical chapels. We can observe a great sailing vault. On the diagonal axes are four chapels lower than those which determine presbytery. Consistency adds fact that whole interior has part of Corinthian style for example columns. Between the chapels there are placed narrow passages.  '''''Hermitages'''''<br /> [[File:Gate to hermitages - Church of Camaldoleses in Warsaw.JPG|thumb|Hermitage Gate, Camaldolese Church, Warsaw]] Walking around the church, we can see 13 [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitages]]. They are arranged in four parallel rows on either side of the central axis formed. Between houses connected by low walls fences are situated gardens. All hermitages have the same interior. In the center there is cross-vaulted hall, on the one side there is a cell and small utility room, on the other side we can see chapel and woodshed.  <big>'''Nowadays'''</big>  At present near the church there is junior high school, high school and UKSW (Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University). Now the church is also a kind of cultural center. The concerts and theatrical performances take place in the crypt, there is also a café. There are several attractions for children such as wooden carousel and a donkey. The church is attractive both for local society and tourists.  <big>'''Bibliography:'''</big> * Maria Brykowska, Kościół Kamedułów na Bielanach, Warszawa: Wyd. PWN, 1982  * Ks.

Set in a [[quarantine]]d [[Boston]] office building, the episode revolves around a thousands-year-old [[virus]] that infects and then influences its victims to attempt to spread the contagion outside of the building.  It was the third ''Fringe'' episode to be written by supervising producer [[Jeff Vlaming]], while it was director [[Deran Sarafian]]'s only credit for the series to date. After his character becomes infected, actor [[Joshua Jackson]] commented during shooting to "just imagine the worst hangover I've ever had and multiply it by ten".<ref name=analyze/>  "What Lies Below" first aired in the United States on January 21, 2010 on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]]. An estimated 6.90 million viewers watched the episode, and it received mixed reviews from critics, with one calling it average and predictable.<ref name=ignreview/>  ==Plot== In [[Boston]], a visibly sick man from the [[Netherlands]] arrives at an office building, only to collapse and die. The veins in his body erupt with blood, spraying surrounding witnesses. The Fringe team arrive on site, and while interviewing the witnesses, another man also becomes sick. The sick man attempts to leave the building, only to be stopped by [[Walter Bishop (Fringe)|Walter]] ([[John Noble]]), who sees the man spray out blood and realizes there is a [[Infectious disease|contagion]]. The building is [[Quarantine|quarantined]] with Walter's son [[Peter Bishop|Peter]] ([[Joshua Jackson]]), FBI agent [[Olivia Dunham|Olivia]] ([[Anna Torv]]), and the rest of the witnesses still inside.  The [[Center for Disease Control|CDC]] arrives and soon clash with Walter, who wants some blood samples to take back to his lab at [[Harvard]]. As another witness, the receptionist, falls ill, the rest begin panicking that the virus is an airborne contagion. Olivia discovers that the Dutch man was an oil consultant who arrived to meet with Mr. Ames, one of the other office workers trapped in the building.  Walter explains that viruses have forms of "personalities," that influence their hosts to act in certain ways. He posits that the virus is not airborne after all, but needs more samples for further tests. Meanwhile the infected receptionist is influenced by the virus, jumps out a window, and also scares Peter into falling into an infected pool of blood. The woman is sprayed with decontaminate spray, as Peter quickly rinses himself off. Knowing he is likely infected, Peter searches through the Dutch man's pockets, leading to the discovery of a briefcase infected by the virus.  Walter continues his theory that the virus wants to escape the building, hence the multiple escape attempts by the infected. The virus was found on a sample taken 10 miles below the earth, and may be 75,000 years old and responsible for wiping out the [[Ice Age]] [[mammals]]. As a [[bio-hazard]] team enters the building to test people for the virus, a CDC official orders the army to prepare for a "level six eradication", because they still do not know how to contain it.  Peter manages to fake the test and hide his infection. He and Olivia begin leading a team of healthy people outside the building, but before Peter is able to leave, his nose bleeds, clearly revealing that he is infected. While the virus overtakes Peter's health and sanity, Walter becomes increasingly distressed as he fears losing his son again, and accidentally blurts out that he "can't let Peter die again" to [[Astrid Farnsworth|Astrid]] ([[Jasika Nicole]]). Despite the threat of eradication and death, he and Astrid remain in the building to run further tests on the Dutch man. Walter realizes that [[sulfuric]] ash killed the virus thousands of years ago, and successfully finds a cure with some [[horseradish]] he found in the office break room.  The CDC agrees to allow Olivia to enter the building and use the air ventilation system to spread some fentanyl gas, which will gain them time while the cure is synthesized. While inside, Peter attacks her, but Olivia is able to turn the air on, successfully knocking out the building's occupants. Peter and everyone else are successfully cured. Astrid later approaches Walter and asks what he meant when he said he couldn't let Peter die again, to which he responds by saying "some things are meant to be left alone."  ==Production== [[File:Fringe Panel 3 2010 CC.jpg|right|thumb|[[Peter Bishop]], played by actor [[Joshua Jackson]] ''(pictured left)'' becomes infected with an ancient virus in the episode.]]  Supervising producer [[Jeff Vlaming]] wrote "What Lies Below",<ref name=mtvreview/> his second episode of the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/jeff-vlaming/credits/243586 |title=Jeff Vlaming: Credits |last= |first=|work=[[TV Guide]] |date=|accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> Filmmaker [[Deran Sarafian]] served as the director,<ref name=sfscope>{{cite web|url=http://sfscope.com/2010/01/black-oil-reduxfringes-what-li.html |title=Black Oil Redux—Fringe's "What Lies Beneath"|last=Stegall |first=Sarah |publisher=[[SFScope]] |date=2010-01-22 |accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> his first and only ''Fringe'' directional credit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/deran-sarafian/credits/188874 |title=Deran Sarafian: Credits |last= |first=|work=[[TV Guide]] |date=|accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> The episode featured one-time guest appearances by actors [[Demore Barnes]], [[Geoff Pierson]], [[Conrad Coates]], [[Natassia Malthe]], and [[David Richmond-Peck]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/fringe-2010/episode-13-season-2/lies/293813 |title=Fringe Episode: "What Lies Below" |last=|first=|work=[[TV Guide]] |date=|accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> Actor [[Joshua Jackson]], who plays an infected [[Peter Bishop]] in the episode, noted during shooting that he found inspiration from "imagin[ing] the worst hangover I've ever had and multiply it by ten".<ref name=analyze>{{cite video |people=[[Anna Torv]], [[Joshua Jackson]], [[Deran Sarafian]], Michael Mitchell, Bob Comer, Angela Uyeda |date=2010 |title=Analyzing the Scene for "What Lies Below"| medium=DVD |publisher=[[Warner Bros.]] Television |location=''Fringe: The Complete Second Season'' Disc 3 }}</ref>   Actress [[Jasika Nicole]] was pleased that the writers decided to let her character discover Walter's secret, commenting "Astrid finds out in a really emotional way because Walter lets it slip to her accidentally. I think that it was really nice for them to invite Astrid into the importance of that instead of keeping her in the dark. At least she knows that she's a part of this family and this affects her. I think she serves as a really important character in these later episodes because Astrid is kind of the only person that isn't directly involved with everything that is still on his side. She has to step up to the plate and be that comfort for him because if he doesn't have anyone there, he's basically going to regress and go back to the place, I think mentally, that he was in when he was in the mental institution.

To simulate her 160-feet fall, stuntwoman Angela Uyeda was placed in a crane 10 to 15 feet above the van and asked to jump onto the van below. The crew removed the roof structure on the van, and carefully rigged it to cave-in upon impact but also make it as painless as possible for Uyeda. To achieve this, they modified the ribs that supported the roof by placing them on pins that would snap, and also added a three-millimeter glass plate that would snap between two sheets of black hard nylon-type plastic to further emphasize the distance she jumped.<ref name=analyze/>  ==Reception== ===Ratings=== The first airing of "What Lies Below" was watched by an estimated 6.90 million viewers in the United States, with a 2.6/7 rating for those aged 18–49.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/01/22/tv-ratings-thursday-deep-end-underwater-bones-annual-high-csi-mentalist-greys-series-lows/39739/|title=TV Ratings Thursday: ''Deep End'' Underwater; ''Bones'' High; ''CSI'', ''Mentalist'', ''Grey's'' Series Lows|last=Gorman|first=Bill|publisher=[[TV by the Numbers]] |date=2010-01-22 |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref> [[SFScope]] writer Sarah Stegall considered these numbers to be "steady but stagnant ratings", as they were "not much different" from the [[Johari Window (Fringe)|previous week]].<ref name=sfscope/>  ===Reviews=== "What Lies Below" received mixed reviews from television critics. ''[[The A.V.

Facing international sanctions, the Syrian government relied on criminal organizations to smuggle goods and money in and out of the country. The economic downturn caused by the conflict and sanctions also led to lower wages for Shabiha members. In response, some Shabiha members began stealing civilian properties, and engaging in kidnappings.<ref name="Organized crime" />  Rebel forces sometimes relied on criminal networks to obtain weapons and supplies. Black market weapon prices in Syria's neighboring countries have significantly increased since the start of the conflict.

(1910–1990) was widely recognized by the engineering community and known for his innovative [[structural engineering]] solutions, as a senior assistant engineer and [[lieutenant]] with the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defense]], a professor at the [[University of Toronto]], as co-founder of the North American firm [[Morrison Hershfield]], and as a prolific author. He was a lifelong advocate of education and the engineering profession.  ==Early life and education==  Hershfield' parents Aaron and Molly Hershfield left Teofipol, [[Ukraine]] in the mid-1890s for [[Manitoba, Canada]] in search of greater opportunities and in the hopes of starting a family. On December 24, 1910 their son Charles Hershfield was born. As a child and later in his teens, Hershfield's interests resided in music, [[baseball]], [[carpentry]], and [[mechanical engineering]]. He attended St. John’s High School in [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba, and even from a young age, highly valued his education.  Hershfield later studied engineering at the [[University of Manitoba]]. Working with two of his classmates, H.F. Peters and W. Gruber, Hershfield submitted the thesis “Some Tests of Welded Joints”. Hershfield graduated in 1930 with the degree of [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[civil engineering]].   During the summer periods as an undergraduate Hershfield worked for the [[Dominion Bridge Company]] in Winnipeg. Upon graduation and until 1932, in conjunction with the Winnipeg City Engineer, he was involved with structural design of bridges, viaducts and subways.  Several years later Hershfield continued his education and received the degree of [[Master of Applied Science]] from the University of Toronto in 1950. His master’s thesis was titled “Series Expansion of Joint Rotations for the Analysis of Rigidly Framed Structures “.<ref name="Engineering Journal" />  ==Working life==  In 1935 Hershfield moved to [[Toronto, Ontario]] and until 1941 was employed with Standard Iron and Steel Works where his skills and services were focused in [[structural design]], estimating, contracting, detailing and supervision of the fabrication and erection of steel structures.  From 1941 to 1943 he was a staff member of the [[Canadian Department of National Defense]], Naval Service, Works and Building Branch as Senior Assistant Engineer, with the rank of Lieutenant. His work during this time included structural design on naval shore establishments including shops, storage facilities, training buildings, and drill halls, of wide variety as to size and materials of construction.<ref name="Engineering Journal" />  After leaving the naval service in 1943, Hershfield joined the staff of the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Toronto. Hershfield taught a variety of courses related to structural engineering and supervised many graduate students. He was also principal instructor in structural engineering in the [[School of Architecture]] at University of Toronto.<ref>“OAA Periodical: Charles Hershfield P.Eng.’’. (March/April 1982). Ontario Association of Architects, p. 5.</ref>  In 1946 Hershfield, along with [[Carson Morrison]], Joe Millman, and Mark Huggins, responded to the post-war building boom by founding the engineering consulting firm Morrison Hershfield Millman and Huggins. The firm today exists under the name [[Morrison Hershfield]], with offices across North America specializing in multidisciplinary engineering and related expertise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morrisonhershfield.com/aboutus/Pages/OurHistory.aspx|title=Morrison Hershfield History|publisher=Morrison Hershfield|accessdate=2011-01-11}}</ref>   Hershfield retired from teaching at the University of Toronto in 1976 after 31 years of service but continued to work closely with Morrison Hershfield almost up to the time of his death.  ==Notable projects== * Assisted with complex structural design of the roof for the [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival]] Theatre, [[Stratford, Ontario]] (1957)<ref name="Engineers Honored" /> * Designed the complex structural roofing system for the Ontario Pavilion Building at [[Expo 67]], Montreal, Quebec (1967)<ref name="Engineers Honored" /> * Assisted with the expansion of the Toronto [[Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto|Mount Sinai Hospital]], Toronto, [[Ontario]]<ref name="Engineers Honored" /> * University of Toronto Medical Science Building, Toronto, Ontario  ==Awards and achievements== * Elected to the grade of Partner with the Engineering Institute of Canada, 1955. * Member of the Publications Committee, for the Engineering Journal, 1970–74. * Elected to [[EIC Fellow|Fellow]] of the [[Engineering Institute of Canada]], 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eic-ici.ca/fellows.html |title=EIC Fellows |publisher=[[Engineering Institute of Canada]] |accessdate={{Format date|2011|2|23}}}}</ref> * Consulting Engineer Designation, [[Association of Professional Engineers]], 1974. * Member of the Committee of Examiners, Ontario Association of Architects, 1974–82 * Member of the [[Canadian Standards Association]] Standards Policy Board, 1977–78. * Requalifed as a Designated Consulting Engineer, Association of Professional Engineers, 1979. * Awarded the Engineering Medal by the Association of [[Professional Engineers Ontario]], 1982.<ref name="Engineering for People" /> * Served as a Structural Engineer on the OAA Committee of Examiners, 1982. * Upon his death, the University of Toronto set up the Charles Hershfield Memorial Scholarship fund to acknowledge Hershfield's significant accomplishments as a structural engineer and professor.

"<page><title>Charles Fairfax (antiquary)</title><text>'''Charles Fairfax''' (1597–1673) was an English antiquary and genealogist.  ==Early life== Fairfax was born at [[Denton, Yorkshire]] on 5 March 1597, and was the seventh and third surviving son of [[Thomas Fairfax, 1st Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Sir Thomas (afterwards first Lord) Fairfax]]. His two surviving brothers (four others were killed fighting in 1631) were [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Ferdinando]] and [[Henry Fairfax (academic)| Henry]]. He entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] on 5 October 1611,<ref>{{acad|id= FRFS611C|name=Fairfax, Charles}}</ref> and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 9 March 1618. About 1627 he married Mary, sole heiress of the Breary family, of [[Scough Hall]] in the forest of Knaresborough and Menston.  The counsellor and annalist of his family, the rest of his life was spent mainly on his family tree, at [[Menston]], Yorkshire.  At Menston he was within a few miles of his paternal home at Denton. <ref name=dnb/>  ==Civil war== A few days before the [[battle of Marston Moor]] (2 July 1644) Cromwell and other parliamentary leaders held a conference at Fairfax's house at Menston around a table now at [[Farnley Hall, Yorkshire]]. While his nephew, [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Sir Thomas]], afterwards the third Lord Fairfax, did much to preserve the minster and archives at York, Charles was engaged with another antiquary, [[Roger Dodsworth]], in the search for and rescue of books and documents. In 1646 he was appointed by his brother, [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Ferdinando]], the second Lord Fairfax, as steward of the courts at [[Ripon]], and during the later years of the Commonwealth was induced to take service as a Colonel of Foot, a position which he held in [[George Monck]]'s army in Scotland at the time of the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of 1660. During Monck's march into Yorkshire he was appointed governor of the town of [[Kingston-upon-Hull]]. This office he held only about a year and then retired to Menston with a pension, granted him by Charles II out of the customs at Hull. <ref name=dnb/>  ==Death and family== He died in Menston in December 1673. The registers of Fewston parish church record his burial, and also that of his wife in 1657; they were both buried in the Fairfax transept of the parish church at [[Otley]], where there was a mural monument to their memory. Among his children were twin brothers, John, a captain in the army, and [[Henry Fairfax (dean)|Henry]], a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, and dean of Norwich, who were so alike as to be indistinguishable by their own mother. <ref name=dnb/>  ==Written work and collections== Fairfax wrote a work in manuscript entitled ''Analecta Fairfaxiana''. It contains pedigrees, carefully written and blazoned on vellum, of all the branches of the Fairfax family, and of many of the families connected with it, interspersed with many genealogical and literary notes, and about fifty anagrams, epigrams, and elegies in Latin. <ref name=dnb/> It went to [[Leeds Castle, Kent]] and then  passed into the library of  Sir [[Thomas Phillipps]]. Along with several related volumes, tt was acquired by Leeds University Library in 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb206brothertoncollectionmsyks2|title=Analecta Fairfaxiana|publisher=Archives Hub|accessdate=31 December 2011}}</ref>  By his will, dated 1672, Fairfax bequeathed manuscripts to [[Lincoln's Inn]].<ref name=dnb>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Fairfax, Charles}}</ref>  ==References== {{reflist}}  {{DNB|wstitle=Fairfax, Charles}} {{onesource|date=February 2011}}  {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME              = Fairfax, Charles | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = English antiquary | DATE OF BIRTH     = 1597 | PLACE OF BIRTH    = | DATE OF DEATH     = 1673 | PLACE OF DEATH    = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Fairfax, Charles}} [[Category:1597 births]] [[Category:1673 deaths]] [[Category:People from Yorkshire]] [[Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge]] [[Category:Roundheads]] [[Category:17th-century English writers]] [[Category:English antiquarians]] [[Category:English genealogists]] [[Category:Fairfax family|Charles]] [[Category:Members of Lincoln's Inn]] [[Category:17th-century antiquarians]]</text></page>",

But as more developments of Punggol 21 were progressively unveiled, the station was opened with the rest of the line in 2003. In 2005, a middle platform was built on the LRT Platform for services to Punggol North but plans for that were aborted and the platform was replaced with walkways.  ==Station layout== {|table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style="border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;" rowspan=5 valign=top|'''L2<br>Platform''' |style="border-top:solid 1px gray;"|Platform 1 |style="border-top:solid 1px gray;" colspan=2|<small> <span style=color:black>{{SLRT lines|Punggol}}: Route A: West Loop Outer towards {{SLRT code|PT|C}}<span style="color:black;"> Punggol</span> via [[Soo Teck LRT Station|Soo Teck]] (after 3pm Daily) (→)</span><br />{{SLRT lines|Punggol}}: Route D: East Loop Inner towards {{SLRT code|PT|C}} Punggol via [[Cove LRT Station|Cove]] (→)</small> |- |style="border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px grey;" colspan=2 align=center|<small>[[Island platform]], doors will open on the right</small> |- |colspan="2"|<span style=color:grey><center>Future trackway reserved for Punggol North Line (covered by granite slabs)</center></span> |- |style="border-top:solid 2px grey;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;" colspan=2 align=center|<small>[[Island platform]], doors will open on the right</small> |- |style="border-bottom:solid 1px gray;"|Platform 2 |style="border-bottom:solid 1px gray;" colspan=2|<small><span style=color:black>{{SLRT lines|Punggol}}: Route B: West Loop Inner towards {{SLRT code|PT|C}}<span style="color:black;"> Punggol</span> via [[Sam Kee LRT Station|Sam Kee]] (until 3pm Daily) (←)</span><br /> {{SLRT lines|Punggol}}: Route C: East Loop Outer towards {{SLRT code|PT|C}} Punggol via [[Damai LRT Station, Singapore|Damai]] (←)</small> |- |style="border-bottom:solid 1px gray;" width=50 valign=top|'''L1''' |style="border-bottom:solid 1px gray;" width=100 valign=top|Main Lobby |style="border-bottom:solid 1px gray;" width=550 valign=top|Faregates, Ticketing Machines, Passenger Service Centre, [[Punggol Bus Interchange]], [[Waterway Point]] (U/C). |- |style="border-bottom:solid 1px gray;" width=50 valign=top|'''B1''' |style="border-bottom:solid 1px gray;" width=100 valign=top|Service Level |style="border-bottom:solid 1px gray;" width=550 valign=top|Restricted Access |- |style="border-bottom:solid 1px gray;" rowspan=3 valign=top|'''B2<br>Platform''' |Platform A |{{SMRT lines|North East}} <small> towards [[HarbourFront MRT Station|{{SMRT code 2I/C|NE|1|CC|29}} HarbourFront]] via {{SMRT-SLRT code 2I/C|NE|16|ST|C}} {{SMRT stations|station=Sengkang}} (→) </small> |- |style="border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;" colspan=2 align=center|<small>[[Island platform]], doors will open on the left, right</small> |- |style="border-bottom:solid 1px gray;"|Platform B |style="border-bottom:solid 1px gray;"|{{SMRT lines|North East}} <small> towards [[HarbourFront MRT Station|{{SMRT code 2I/C|NE|1|CC|29}} HarbourFront]] via {{SMRT-SLRT code 2I/C|NE|16|ST|C}} {{SMRT stations|station=Sengkang}} (→) </small> |}  ==Transport connections== ===Rail=== {| style="text-align:centre; font-size:95%; border:1px solid black" |- !

The team plays [[Oxford University RFC]] in the annual [[The Varsity Match|Varsity Match]] at [[Twickenham Stadium]] every December.   Cambridge players wear light blue and white hooped jerseys with a red lion crest. Many have gone on to represent their country and the [[British and Irish Lions]]; a few, most notably [[Daniel Vickerman|Dan Vickerman]], have represented Cambridge after successful international careers. Whilst at Cambridge University [[James Bevan]] became the first captain of the [[Wales national rugby union team]].  == History == Football is believed to have been introduced to Cambridge University in 1839 by [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] fresher [[Albert Pell]].<ref name="Marshall13">Marshall (1951), pg 13.</ref> Pell had matriculated to Cambridge from [[Rugby School]], where the game of rugby is believed to have originated. Cambridge University Rugby Union Football Club was officially established in 1872, around three years after the Oxford rugby club was founded. The first Varsity match was contested between the two teams on 10 February 1872.<ref name="Marshall17">Marshall (1951), pg 17.</ref> The Cambridge team was led out by captain [[Isaac Cowley Lambert]], wearing pink jerseys with a monogram on the left breast.<ref name="Marshall17"/> Played away at the Park in Oxford, Cambridge lost by a single goal to nil. CURUFC officials helped to draw up the laws of the game that were adopted by the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU) when it was established in 1871. Cambridge became a Constituent Body of the Union in 1872, a status which the club still holds today. In [[1873-74 Home Nations rugby union matches|1874]], Cambridge provided their first international player directly from the club, when [[John Batten]] represented [[England national rugby union team|England]] in the third encounter against [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]].

The Flyers lost in the second round of the playoffs to the [[New Jersey Devils]] in five games.  ==Off-season== Following his penchant for making big moves, Flyers General Manager [[Paul Holmgren]] pulled off perhaps the most stunning move of his tenure, trading captain [[Mike Richards]] to the [[Los Angeles Kings]] for [[Brayden Schenn]], [[Wayne Simmonds]] and a 2012 second-round draft pick, as well as [[Jeff Carter]] to the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] for their 2011 first-round pick ([[Sean Couturier]]) and [[Jakub Voráček|Jakub Voracek]], all within the span of an hour on June 23. Later that same day, Holmgren addressed the Flyers' long-standing goaltending issues by signing the [[Arizona Coyotes|Phoenix Coyotes]]' [[Ilya Bryzgalov]] to a nine-year, $51 million contract. On July 1, the Flyers signed [[Jaromír Jágr|Jaromir Jagr]] to a one-year contract, [[Maxime Talbot]] to a five-year contract and [[Andreas Lilja]] to a two-year contract.  ==Regular season== [[Chris Pronger]] was named the Flyers' captain;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flyers.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=588692 |title=Pronger Named Captain |publisher=Philadelphia Flyers |date=September 16, 2011 |accessdate=December 20, 2014}}</ref> however, 13 games into the season, he was lost for the remainder of the regular season and playoffs with severe post-concussion syndrome.  Bryzgalov's play ranged from spectacular to subpar, including being benched in favor of [[Sergei Bobrovsky]] for the Flyers' 3–2 loss to the [[New York Rangers]] in the [[2012 NHL Winter Classic|2012 Winter Classic]]. Twelve rookies suited up for the Flyers during the season, with the play of Sean Couturier, Brayden Schenn and [[Matt Read]] standing out impressively.  The Flyers concluded the regular season with the most powerplay opportunities of all teams (335), the most powerplay goals scored (66) and the most powerplay opportunities against (319).<ref>http://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2012.html</ref>  ===Season standings=== {{2011–12 NHL Atlantic Division standings|team=PHI}} {{2011–12 NHL Eastern Conference standings|team=PHI}}  ==Playoffs== The Flyers drew the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in the first round of the [[2012 Stanley Cup Playoffs|playoffs]], a series in which the two teams combined for an NHL-record 45 goals in the first four games and a total of 309 penalty minutes in an intense, fight-filled series. The Flyers pulled off the upset in six games against a Pittsburgh team that was heavily favored to win the [[Stanley Cup]]. But in the second round against the [[New Jersey Devils]], the Flyers' run-and-gun style of play was stymied by the Devils' forechecking and defense, and the Flyers were eliminated in five games.  ==Schedule and results==  ===Pre-season=== {| class="toccolours"  style="width:100%; clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; text-align:center;" |- ! colspan="2" style="background:#fff; border-top:#F4793E 5px solid; border-bottom:#000 5px solid;"| 2011 pre-season<ref>{{cite web|title=2011-2012 Preseason Schedule/Results - Philadelphia Flyers - Schedule|url=http://flyers.nhl.com/club/schedule.htm?season=20112012&gameType=1|publisher=''Philadelphia Flyers''}}</ref>  |- valign="top" |<div class="NavFrame"> <div class="NavHead" style="background:#fff; border-top:#F4793E 2px solid; border-bottom:#000 2px solid;">Pre-season: 4–2–1 (Home: 2–1–1; Road: 2–1–0)</div> <div class="NavContent" style="display:none;"> {| class="wikitable" style="width:100%;" |- bgcolor="#dddddd" !

"<page><title>Feeding disorder</title><text>A '''feeding disorder'''  in infancy or early childhood is a child's refusal to eat certain food groups, textures, solids or liquids for a period of at least one month, which causes them to not gain enough weight or grow naturally.<ref name="minddisorder.com"/> Feeding disorders resemble [[failure to thrive]], except that in feeding disorder there is no medical or physiological condition that can explain the very small amount of food the children consume or their lack of growth.<ref name="minddisorder.com">{{cite web|title=Feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood|url=http://www.minddisorders.com/Del-Fi/Feeding-disorder-of-infancy-or-early-childhood.html|work=Encyclopedia of Mental Disorders|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=26 February 2011}}</ref>  ==Symptoms== Children attempting to swallow different food textures often vomit, gag, or choke while eating. At feeding times they may react negatively to attempts to feed them, and refuse to eat.<ref name=KKlod>{{cite web|title=Feeding Disorders|url=http://www.kennedykrieger.org/kki_diag.jsp?pid=1084|publisher=Kennedy Krieger Institute|accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref>  Other symptoms include difficulty in chewing or vomiting and spitting whilst eating. Many children may have feeding difficulties and may be picky eaters, but most of them still have a fairly healthy diet. Children with a feeding disorder however, will completely abandon some of the food groups, textures, or liquids that are necessary for human growth and development.  Children with this disorder can develop much more slowly and can also experience behavioral problems. In severe cases the child seems to feel socially isolated.<ref name=KKlod/>  ==Types== Feeding disorder has been divided into six further sub-types:<ref name=Sexon>{{cite book|last=Sexson|first=Sandra B.|title=Child and adolescent psychiatry|year=2005|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=1-4051-1768-0|pages=399}}</ref>  # Feeding disorder of state regulation # Feeding disorder of reciprocity (neglect)''' # Infantile [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] # Sensory food aversion # Feeding disorder associated with concurrent medical condition # Post-traumatic feeding disorder  ==Associated problems== A few of the medical and psychological conditions that have been known to be associated with this disorder include:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.kennedykrieger.org/patient-care/diagnoses-disorders/feeding-disorders | title=Feeding Disorders | publisher=Kennedy Krieger Institute | date=2012 | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref> *Gastrointestinal motility disorders  *Oral-motor dysfunction  *Failure to thrive  *Prematurity  *Food allergies *Behavior management issues *Sensory Problems  A child that is suffering from malnutrition can have permanently stunted mental and physical development. Getting treatment early is essential and can prevent many of the complications.<ref>{{cite web|title=Feeding Disorders|url=http://www.umm.edu/ency/article/001540trt.htm|accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref> They can also develop further eating disorders later in life such as [[anorexia nervosa]], or they could become a limited eater—though they could still be a healthy child they may become a picky eater.  ==Diagnosis== A barium swallow test is often performed, where the child is given a liquid or food with barium in it. This allows the consulting medical practitioners to trace the swallow-function on an x ray or other investigative system such as a [[X-ray computed tomography|CATScan]]. An endoscopic assignment test can also be performed, where an endoscope is used to view the oesophagus and throat on a screen. It can also allow viewing of how the patient will react during feeding.<ref>{{cite web|title=Feeding Disorders and swallowing disorders|url= http://www.asha.org/public/speech/swallowing/feedswallowchildren.htm|accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref>  ==Treatments== There is no quick cure, and treatment will be based on what problems may be causing the feeding disorder. Depending on the condition, the following steps can be taken: increasing the number of foods that are accepted, increasing the amount of calories and the amount of fluids; checks for vitamin or mineral deficiencies; finding out what the illnesses or psychosocial problems are. To accomplish these goals patients may have to be hospitalized for extensive periods of time. Treatment involves professionals from multiple fields of study including, but not limited to; occupational and speech therapist who specialize in feeding disorders, dietitians, psychologists and physician. To obtain the best results, treatment should include a behavior modification plan under the guidance of multiple professionals. If the child has oral motor difficulties related to the feeding disorder a pediatric occupational or speech therapist who is trained in feeding disorders and oral motor function should help develop a plan. <ref>{{cite web|title=Feeding Disorder of Early Childhood|url=http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&id=14504&cn=37|accessdate=26 June 2011|authors=Andrea Barkoukis, M.A., Natalie Staats Reiss, Ph.D., and Mark Dombeck, Ph.D}}</ref>  ==Epidemiology== Some 25% to 40% of infants and children are reported to have feeding problems—mainly [[colic]], vomiting, slow feeding, and refusal to eat.<ref name="cfp journal">{{cite journal|last=Bernard-Bonnin|first=AC|title=Feeding problems of infants and toddlers|journal=Canadian Family Physician|year=2006|volume=Vol 52|issue=Issue 10|url=http://www.cfp.ca/cgi/reprint/52/10/1247}}</ref> It has been reported that up to 80% of infants with developmental handicaps also demonstrate feeding problems while 1 to 2% of infants aged less than one year show severe food refusal and poor growth.<ref name="essentials">{{cite book|last=Kay|first=Jerald|title=Essentials of Psychiatry|year=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons Ltd|location=West Sussex|isbn=0470018542|pages=1078}}</ref> Among [[Preterm birth|infants born prematurely]], 40% to 70% experience some form of feeding problem.<ref name="minddisorder.com"/>  ==See also== [[Selective eating disorder]]  == References == {{reflist}}  ==External links== *[http://www.kennedykrieger.org/kki_diag.jsp?pid=1084 Kennedy Krieger] list of associated problems *[http://www.asha.org/public/speech/swallowing/feedswallowchildren.htm American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA)] Feeding and Swallowing Disorders (Dysphagia) in Children *[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001540.htm U.S. National Library of Medicine] Treating Children With Feeding Disorders   [[Category:Malnutrition]] [[Category:Eating disorders]]</text></page>",

I think the reasons for deletion are only valid at first glance. Yes, [[WP:MOS]] is "only" a guideline but still, constantly deliberately violating without being willing to talk about it will sooner or later be disruptive and, despite the arguments at the TFD, deliberately disrupting Wikipedia in any way, even by persistently breaking WP:MOS ''is'' a reason for a block per [[WP:BLOCK]]. There is one user that comes to mind (who I don't want to name though) who persists on adding credentials to articles, like "Dr.", "Mr.", "MP" etc., in violation of [[WP:CREDENTIAL]]. It became so bad that now whole pages of page revisions consist of their edits to change this and several users reverting them. They have been warned using {{tl|uw-mos1}} to {{tl|uw-mos3}} but they have neither tried to discuss their edits nor reacted in any other way. I think if a user acts in this way, they should be blocked sooner or later because of disruption. But instead of adding a {{tl|uw-vandalism4}} warning, I think the correct way to inform them of their soon-to-be-applied block should be the template that directly tells them what disruptive behavior is not tolerated. {{tl|uw-mos4}} fulfills this purpose in such cases. Regards '''[[User:SoWhy|<span style="font-variant:small-caps; color: #AC0000">So</span>]][[User talk:SoWhy|<span style="font-variant:small-caps; color: #35628F">Why</span>]]''' 23:08, 6 March 2011 (UTC) *As much as a relist for wider input seems entirely reasonable, do you really think a uw-mos4 template is necessary?  It seems to me that any time that a user could be blocked for violations of the MOS, they will have gone far beyond a simple 4-warnings-then-block sort of system and a less general final warning should be given.  The circumstance you describe, for instance, is a much wider pattern than only four instances of MOS violation and the user would benefit more from a personalized note than a templated one.  Cheers.  <font color="green">[[User:Lifebaka|''lifebaka'']]</font>[[User talk:Lifebaka|'''++''']] 03:57, 7 March 2011 (UTC) :*By the same argument, do we really need most of the level 4 warnings? {{tl|uw-generic4}} would cover most such circumstances, wouldn't it? The point is that if a user is bent on disrupting Wikipedia by messing up the layout again and again while probably not acting in bad faith (other than ignoring the warnings and tries to talk to them), then it would be good if the final warning reflected the reason for the block that may happen and didn't just say "stop being disruptive" (but "stop being disruptive by doing..."). Sure, more personal notes are preferable but in the case I used as an example, they didn't help, so I think a big red warning sign saying clearly "you will be blocked" may be helpful as well. Most user warnings can be personalized after all but I like to think that combining it with a templated message may be more effective.

On the one hand, I question whether it's ever really appropriate to block anyone purely for violations of the MOS.  I can imagine circumstances in which they could be blocked for repeatedly and ''disruptively'' violating the MOS, but in that case, the reason for the block is their tendentious behaviour, not the MOS violations ''per se''.  I note that this view was unanimous in the discussion, and I see that Tim Song implemented it.<p>On the other hand, I can see where SoWhy is coming from.  Although the procedure used was the TfD process, in fact what's proposed is more than just an adjustment of our templates—it's effectively a revision to the blocking rules.  Quite a small revision, all things considered, but still, I don't feel 100% comfortable about blocking guidelines being determined by a consensus of three editors at a TfD.<p>I'm going to '''endorse''' Tim Song's closure but then recommend that the template is temporarily '''undeleted''' while SoWhy raises a better-attended discussion in the venue of his choice (RFC, AN, or whatever).—[[User:S Marshall|<font face="Verdana" color="Maroon">'''S Marshall'''</font>]] <small>[[User talk:S Marshall|T]]/[[Special:Contributions/S Marshall|C]]</small> 12:22, 7 March 2011 (UTC) :*The point was that disruptive behavior is usually the reason for a block in such circumstances. Still we have a number of different level 4 warnings that all say "you may be blocked without further warning for being disruptive by doing XXX...". So yeah, the reason for blocking wouldn't be the violations but the constant violations without being willing to talk about the edits or even acknowledging them in any way. That's the disruption in this case and I would propose that the template reflects this if undeleted (e.g. "your constant violations of WP:MOS without being willing to talk about it...").

He was a leading artist in the [[Birmingham]] area between 1850 and 1880, and his work is a valuable historical record of local buildings of that period.  ==Life and work==  Everitt was born in Birmingham, the son of Edward Everitt, an art dealer, and grandson of Allen Everitt, a well-known local artist and art teacher. His maternal grandfather was David Parkes, the [[Shropshire]] [[antiquarian]]. He showed an early talent for art and received lessons from [[David Cox (artist)|David Cox]], with whom he remained a friend. His specialty was drawing old buildings and their interiors. Taking Birmingham as a centre he made careful drawings of almost every spot in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] of archaeological or historical interest. Between the ages of thirty and forty, he made painting tours of Belgium, France and Germany. After this, he devoted himself particularly to building interiors, his work being mainly carried out in [[watercolour]].<ref name="dnb">{{cite DNB|no-icon=1|prescript=|volume=18|pages=88–89|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/dictionarynatio23stepgoog#page/n100/mode/1up|title=EVERITT, ALLEN EDWARD}}</ref>  [[File:Everitt - Aston Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Aston Hall]] nr. Birmingham]] In 1857, Everitt joined the [[Royal Birmingham Society of Artists]], becoming, in 1858, honorary secretary, a post he held until his death. He taught drawing for many years at the ''[[Deaf and Dumb Institution (Birmingham)|Deaf and Dumb Institution]]'' in Church Road, [[Edgbaston]], of which he was also, virtually, the secretary. In 1870, the archaeological section of the [[Birmingham and Midland Institute|Midlands Institute]] was formed, and Everitt was appointed one of its honorary secretaries.<ref>See: George Griffith. ''History of the free-schools, colleges, hospitals, and asylums of Birmingham'' (London: W.

In June 1880, he was appointed honorary curator of the municipal "Birmingham Free Art Gallery", the forerunner of the [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]].<ref name="dnb" />  In 1854, Everitt completed an important series of drawings of [[Aston Hall]], in [[Warwickshire]], which were used to illustrate Davidson's ''History of the holts of Aston, with a description of the family mansion'' (see bibliography). He also illustrated J. B. Bunce's "''History of old [[St Martin in the Bull Ring|St. Martin's]]''" (1875), the parish church of Birmingham.<ref name="dnb" />  In 1880, Everitt married Frances Hudson. He died on 11 June 1882, at Edgbaston, where he had lived most of his life, of "congestion of the lungs".

A [[Franco–Syrian Treaty of Independence (1936)|treaty of independence]] was made in 1936 to grant independence to Syria and end official French rule, but the French parliament refused to accept the agreement. From 1940 to 1941, the Syrian Republic was under the control of [[Vichy France]], and upon liberation in 1941 became a [[sovereign state]]. In 1958, Syria joined with [[Egypt]] in forming the [[United Arab Republic]].  ==French Mandate prior to the Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence==  The project of a new constitution was discussed by a Constituent Assembly elected in April 1928, but as the pro-independence [[National Bloc (Syria)|National Bloc]] had won a majority and insisted on the insertion of several articles "that did not preserve the prerogatives of the mandatary power", the Assembly was dissolved on August 9, 1928. On May 14, 1930, the [[State of Syria]] was declared the Republic of Syria and a new Syrian constitution was promulgated by the French High Commissioner, in the same time as the Lebanese Constitution, the ''Règlement du Sandjak d'Alexandrette'', the Statute of the Alawi Government, the Statute of the Jabal Druze State.<ref name="takla">Youssef Takla, "[http://books.google.com/books?id=easK2KFwWssC&pg=PA91 Corpus juris du Mandat français]", in: {{cite book|last=|first= S.|title=The British and French Mandates in Comparative Perspectives|editor=Méouchy, Nadine and  Sluglet, Peter (eds.)|publisher=Brill|year=2004|pages=91|isbn=978-90-04-13313-6|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=easK2KFwWssC|accessdate=2012-04-01|language=French}}</ref> A new flag was also mentioned in this constitution: :The Syrian flag shall be composed as follows, the length shall be double the height.

It promised gradual independence but kept the Syrian Mountains under French control. The Syrian head of state at the time was a French puppet, [[Muhammad 'Ali Bay al-'Abid]]. Fierce opposition to this treaty was spearheaded by senior nationalist and parliamentarian [[Hashim al-Atassi]], who called for a [[1936 Syrian general strike|sixty day strike]] in protest. Atassi's political coalition, the [[National Bloc (Syria)|National Bloc]], mobilized massive popular support for his call. Riots and demonstrations raged, and the economy came to a standstill.  ==Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence== {{main|Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence|Sanjak of Alexandretta}}  After negotiations in March with Damien de Martel, the French High Commissioner in Syria, Hashim al-Atassi went to Paris heading a senior Bloc delegation. The new [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]]-led French government, formed in June 1936 after the [[French legislative election, 1936|April–May elections]], had agreed to recognize the National Bloc as the sole legitimate representatives of the Syrian people and invited al-Atassi to independence negotiations. The resulting treaty called for immediate recognition of Syrian independence as a sovereign republic, with full emancipation granted gradually over a 25 year period.  In 1936, the Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence was signed, a treaty that would not be ratified by the French legislature. However, the treaty allowed Jabal Druze, the Alawite (now called [[Latakia]]), and Alexandretta to be incorporated into the Syrian republic within the following two years. Greater Lebanon (now the Lebanese Republic) was the only state that did not join the Syrian Republic. [[Hashim al-Atassi]], who was Prime Minister under King Faisal's brief reign (1918–1920), was the first president to be elected under a new constitution adopted after the independence treaty.  The treaty guaranteed incorporation of previously autonomous [[Druze]] and [[Alawite]] regions into [[Greater Syria]], but not [[Lebanon]], with which France signed a similar treaty in November. The treaty also promised curtailment of French intervention in Syrian domestic affairs as well as a reduction of French troops, personnel and military bases in Syria. In return, Syria pledged to support France in times of war, including the use of its [[air space]], and to allow France to maintain two military bases on Syrian territory. Other political, economic and cultural provisions were included.  Atassi returned to Syria in triumph on September 27, 1936 and was elected [[List of Presidents of Syria|President of the Republic]] in November.  In September 1938, France again separated the Syrian [[Sanjak of Alexandretta]] and transformed it into the [[State of Hatay]]. The State of Hatay joined Turkey in the following year, in June 1939. Syria did not recognize the incorporation of Hatay into Turkey and the issue is still disputed until the present time.  The emerging threat of [[Adolf Hitler]] induced a fear of being outflanked by [[Nazi Germany]] if France relinquished its colonies in the [[Middle East]]. That, coupled with lingering imperialist inclinations in some levels of the French government, led France to reconsider its promises and refuse to ratify the treaty. Also, France ceded the [[Sanjak of Alexandretta]], whose territory was guaranteed as part of Syria in the treaty, to [[Turkey]]. Riots again broke out, Atassi resigned, and Syrian independence was deferred until after [[World War II]].  ==World War II and aftermath==  With the fall of France in 1940 during World War II, Syria came under the control of the [[Vichy Government]] until the British and [[Free French]] [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign|invaded and occupied]] the country in July 1941. Syria proclaimed its independence again in 1941 but it wasn't until 1 January 1944, that it was recognized as an independent republic.  In the 1940s, Britain secretly advocated the creation of a Greater Syrian state that would secure Britain preferential status in military, economic and cultural matters, in return for putting a complete halt to Jewish ambition in Palestine. France and the United States opposed British hegemony in the region, which eventually led to the creation of Israel.<ref>https://www.haaretz.co.il/hasen/spages/950373.html</ref>  On 27 September 1941, France proclaimed, by virtue of, and within the framework of the Mandate, the independence and sovereignty of the Syrian State. The proclamation said "the independence and sovereignty of Syria and Lebanon will not affect the juridical situation as it results from the Mandate Act. Indeed, this situation could be changed only with the agreement of the Council of the League of Nations, with the consent of the Government of the United States, a signatory of the Franco-American Convention of April 4, 1924, and only after the conclusion between the French Government and the Syrian and Lebanese Governments of treaties duly ratified in accordance with the laws of the French Republic.<ref>See Foreign relations of the United States diplomatic papers, 1941. The British Commonwealth; the Near East and Africa Volume III (1941), pages 809-810; and Statement of General de Gaulle of November 29, 1941, concerning the Mandate for Syria and Lebanon,  Marjorie M. Whiteman, Digest of International Law, vol. 1 (Washington, D.C.: U. S. Government Printing Office, 1963) 680-681</ref>  Benqt Broms said that it was important to note that there were several founding members of the United Nations whose statehood was doubtful at the time of the San Francisco Conference and that the Government of France still considered Syria and Lebanon to be mandates.<ref>See International law: achievements and prospects, by Mohammed Bedjaoui, UNESCO, Martinus Nijhoff; 1991, ISBN 92-3-102716-6, page 46 [http://books.google.com/books?id=jrTsNTzcY7EC&pg=PA46&dq=&client=#v=onepage&q=&f=false]</ref>  Duncan Hall said "Thus, the Syrian mandate may be said to have been terminated without any formal action on the part of the League or its successor. The mandate was terminated by the declaration of the mandatory power, and of the new states themselves, of their independence, followed by a process of piecemeal unconditional recognition by other powers, culminating in formal admission to the United Nations. Article 78 of the Charter ended the status of tutelage for any member state: 'The trusteeship system shall not apply to territories which have become Members of the United Nations, relationship among which shall be based on respect for the principle of sovereign equality.'"<ref>Mandates, Dependencies and Trusteeship, by H. Duncan Hall, Carnegie Endowment, 1948, pages 265-266</ref>  On 29 May 1945, France bombed [[Damascus]] and tried to arrest its democratically elected leaders. While French planes were bombing [[Damascus]], Prime Minister [[Faris al-Khoury]] was at the founding conference of the [[United Nations]] in San Francisco, presenting [[Syria]]'s claim for independence from the [[French Mandate]]. Continuing pressure from Syrian nationalist groups and British pressure forced the French to evacuate their last troops on 17 April 1946.  ==Independence==  Syrian independence was acquired in 1946. Although rapid economic development followed the declaration of independence, Syrian politics from independence through the late 1960s was marked by upheaval. The early years of independence were marked by political instability.  In 1948, Syria was involved in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War|Arab-Israeli War]] with the newly created [[State of Israel]]. The Syrian army was pressed out of the [[Israel]]i areas, but fortified their strongholds on the [[Golan]] and managed to keep their old borders and occupy some additional territory.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} In July 1949, Syria was the last Arab country to sign an armistice agreement with Israel.  On 29 March 1949, Syria's national government was overthrown by a [[March 1949 Syrian coup d'état|military coup d'état led by Hussni al-Zaim]]. Later that year, on 14 August 1949, Zaim was overthrown by his colleague Sami al-Hinnawi. A few months later, in December 1949, Hinnawi was overthrown by Colonel [[Adib al-Shishakli]]. The latter undermined civilian rule and led to Shishakli's complete seizure of power in 1951. Shishakli continued to rule the country until 1954, when [[1954 Syrian coup d'état|growing public opposition forced him to resign]] and leave the country. The national government was restored, but again to face instability, this time coming from abroad. After the overthrow of President Shishakli in the February [[1954 Syrian coup d'état|1954 coup]], continued political maneuvering supported by competing factions in the military eventually brought Arab nationalist and socialist elements to power. From 1946 to 1956, Syria had 20 different cabinets and drafted four separate constitutions.  During the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, after the invasion of the [[Sinai Peninsula]] by [[Israel]]i troops, and the intervention of British and French troops, [[martial law]] was declared in Syria. Later Syrian and Iraqi troops were brought into [[Jordan]] to prevent a possible Israeli invasion. The November 1956 attacks on Iraqi pipelines were in retaliation for Iraq's acceptance into the [[Baghdad Pact]]. In early 1957 [[Iraq]] advised Egypt and Syria against a conceivable takeover of Jordan.  In November 1956, Syria signed a pact with the [[Soviet Union]], providing a foothold for [[Communist]] influence within the government in exchange for planes, tanks, and other military equipment being sent to Syria. This increase in the strength of Syrian military technology worried [[Turkey]], as it seemed feasible that Syria might attempt to retake [[İskenderun|Iskenderon]], a formerly Syrian city now in Turkey. On the other hand, Syria and the [[USSR]] accused Turkey of massing its troops at the Syrian border. During this standoff, Communists gained more control over the Syrian government and military. Only heated debates in the United Nations (of which Syria was an original member) lessened the threat of war.  Syria's political instability during the years after the 1954 coup, the parallelism of Syrian and [[Egypt]]ian policies, and the appeal of Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdal Nasser]]'s leadership in the wake of the Suez crisis created support in Syria for union with Egypt. On February 1, 1958, Syrian president [[Shukri al-Kuwatli]] and Nasser announced the merging of the two countries, creating the [[United Arab Republic]], and all Syrian political parties, as well as the Communists therein, ceased overt activities.  ==References== {{reflist}}  {{Syria topics}}  {{coord missing|Syria}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Syrian Republic (1930-1958)}} [[Category:Modern history of Syria]] [[Category:World Digital Library related]] [[Category:1930s establishments in Mandatory Syria]]</text></page>",

It was described by Resser in 1938, and the type species is ''Acmarhachis typicalis''.<ref>[http://www.trilobites.info/generic_names_Jell%26Adrain2003.pdf Available Generic Names for Trilobites] P.A.

As in all Agnostina, ''Acmarhachis'' has two [[thorax]] segments. When Agnostina are enroled, a tiny opening between the cephalon and the thorax becomes visible (the cephalothoracic aperture) that uniquely distinguishes this group from the [[Eodiscina]]. A feature shared with all Agnostoidea is that the frontal lobe of the central raised area of the cephalon (or glabella) is not laterally expanded compared to the backward lobe, like in the [[Condylopygoidea]]. In ''Acmarhachis'' the furrow at midline between the front of the glabella and the border is weak or absent. The glabella has a long [[Ogive|ogival]] to [[Rectangle|subquadrate]] front lobe, and the furrow defining it at its back is straight. The back lobe of the glabella is accompanied by two triangular basal lobes of moderate to large size. On the pygidium the axis or rhachis reaches the border. It is divided along its length in three lobes. It is shaped a bit like an [[amphora]], the back pointed and strongly constricted across the middle lobe. The middle lobe also carries a node where it contacts the posterior lobe.<ref name='Treatise'/>  ==References== {{reflist}}  [[Category:Agnostida]] [[Category:Cambrian trilobites]] [[Category:Fossils of Canada]] [[Category:Fossils of Kazakhstan]]</text></page>",

The second is a piece in the entertainment section of the JPost, which talks about the comedy act named 'Comedy for Koby', nothing about the murders. The third is again in a local paper-the JPost, which is an interview with the father of Koby talking about the Itamar attacks, not about the murder of Koby. I think it is quite clear outside Israel the murders are quite unimportant and not talked about. Also, according to Roscelese the legislation in the US congress which many of the keep voters mentioned was never passed. So, I think this murder case is like many that happen everyday, it is in the local news, and possibly international news when it is part of a greater conflict or a famous person, but by the end of the week it is non-notable.

He was co-advised by Gordon McAlpine after Kirshner moved to Harvard.  His dissertation established the existence of small, dwarf galaxies with emission-lines on the edges of galaxy supercluster voids.  Moody did post-doctoral research at ''The Institute for Astronomy'' at the [[University of New Mexico]] where he worked with Stephen Gregory and Jack Burns on questions of large-scale galaxy structure.  Following this, Moody was a professor of astronomy at [[Weber State University]] until he joined the BYU faculty in 1990 as a professor in the Physics and Astronomy Department .  Moody is best known for his work in astronomical publishing. He served three years as assistant managing editor of the ''Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series'' (''ASPCS'') from 2001 to 2004 when he was appointed as Managing Editor, a post he held for 5 years until 2009.  Under his direction the ''ASPCS'', the largest publisher of astronomical conference information in the world, transitioned to full electronic submissions and distribution without a decline in service or revenue. He was elected to the ''American Astronomical Society'' publications board serving from December 2010 to 2014.  Moody received both the BYU Alcuin Award and Karl G. Maeser General Education Professorship for excellence in general education teaching. He was involved in The KPNO International Spectroscopic Survey.<ref>[http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-3881/120/1/80 report of the KPNO International Spectroscopic Survey]</ref> and is the principal author of the textbook '''''Physical Science Foundations'''''.

His first position was [[Archbishop of Brisbane]] and he finished in post as [[Bishop of London]].  He ministered to many people over his lifetime (1885 – 1977) and worked in many cities and towns. Bishop Wand School decided to choose some of the places where the Bishop visited and ministered as its House names.<ref>[http://www.designs365.co.uk/bishopwand/Pages/19.%20House%20System.pdf House System] Bishop Wand School - retrieved 2014-10-30.</ref>  A small minority of the [[ecclesiastical parish|parish]] land has long belonged to St Paul's in return for annual funding and the [[advowson|right to appoint the vicar]]: in 1222 the right to appoint the vicar of Sunbury-on-Thames was transferred along with the [[feudal system|manor]] from Westminster Abbey to the body representing the cathedral, the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's.

'''''Sterne's Captive''''', first exhibited by the artist in 1778, is a similar painting by Wright in the [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]]. The latter painting resulted in a very rare engraving, as its purchaser commissioned a print run of only twenty copies before the copper printing plate was destroyed. In 2012, Derby Museum commissioned another ''Captive painting'' from Emma Tooth.  ==Description== Both paintings shows the despair of a traveller who finds himself abandoned in a foreign jail.<ref name=tate/> ''The Captive'' title is based on the section of the same name in [[Laurence Sterne]]'s ''[[A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy]]'' (1768). In the episode in question, the hero of the story, Yorick, imagines that he is imprisoned in the [[Bastille]] because he has lost his passport. Yorick is later released because his name is taken to indicate that he is an important person, because he is a court jester: [[Yorick]] is a jester in Shakespeare's play ''[[Hamlet]]''. The journey takes place in 1762, when Britain was [[Seven Years' War|at war with France]], and imprisonment was a real possibility for a traveller from a hostile country.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Sentimental Journey and Other Writings|last= Sterne|first= Laurence|editor1-first=Ian|editor1-last=Jack|editor2-first=Tim|editor2-last=Parnell|year=2008|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=[[Oxford]]|isbn=978-0-19-953718-1|page=236}}</ref>  ==History== [[File:Captive John Stavely study.jpg|thumb|left|A study of John Stavely for Wright's second version]] The pose of the model in Wright's first painting is the same as that used by [[Michelangelo]] when painting [[The Creation of Adam]] on the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]].<ref name=sour/> And the first ''captive'' painting was made by Wright while in Rome in 1774. After its completion he had to import it back into Britain; [[Llewellyn Jewitt]] records that he nearly imported it free of tax but a late objection obliged him to pay import tax. The debate focused on whether the sitter was Roman and it was argued that the sitter should have been better dressed.<ref name=jewitt>{{cite journal|last=Jewitt|first=Llewellyn|journal=The Art Journal London p353|year=1866|volume=5|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=M45CAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA353&dq=captive+joseph+wright&hl=en&ei=1P8NTtnTJ4X6sgbrueGIDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=captive%20joseph%20wright&f=false|title= Wright|accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref> <ref name="nicolson">[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ms09AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA54&dq=Guy+of+Lusignan+prisoner&hl=en&ei=24gLTvS_JsiBhQf59LnmDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&q=captive%20king&f=false Joseph Wright of Derby:Painter of Light], Benedict Nicolson</ref>  The first painting was made into a [[stipple engraving]] by [[Thomas Ryder]] in 1779 and it was published by [[John Boydell|John]] and [[Josiah Boydell]] in 1786.<ref name=tate>[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/gothicnightmares/rooms/room4.htm Room 4: Gothic Gloom], The Tate, London</ref> However an earlier [[Mezzotint|mezzotint engraving]] by [[John Raphael Smith]] of the later 1778 painting had been commissioned by [[John Milnes]] after he bought the painting at a [[Royal Academy]] show.

In 2012, Derby Museum commissioned the English Artist Emma Tooth to create a painting based on Wright's paintings. She chose to mimic the construction of ''The Captive''. She took the classical pose of the captive in Wright's version and moved it to a modern man who has chosen to waste his time in front of the television. Tooth noted that the man in the painting (and the model) has "don’t count the days, make the days count" tattooed on his chest.<ref name=sour>{{cite web|title=Picks of the Harvest|url=http://www.sourharvest.com/|publisher=Sour Harvest Exhibition|accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref>  ==References== {{reflist}}  {{Derby Museum}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Captive (painting)}} [[Category:Paintings by Joseph Wright of Derby]] [[Category:1770s paintings]]</text></page>",

The two ships were launched as [[SS Gneisenau (1935)|''Gneisenau'']] and ''Potsdam'' in 1935 and operated in peace time by [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]]. After the outbreak of war, the ships were requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine as transports, and in May 1942, plans were drawn up to convert them into aircraft carriers. The ships were not identical, but were similar enough in size to allow identical outfitting.  ''Gneisenau'' and ''Potsdam'' were to be renamed ''Jade'' and ''Elbe'', respectively. Once converted, the ships were intended to operate twelve [[Ju-87]] Stuka dive bombers and twelve [[Bf-109]] fighters. Work on ''Jade'' was not started and the conversion project was abandoned in November 1942. She returned to service as a [[troopship]], only to be sunk by a mine in the western [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]. ''Elbe'' actually began the conversion process in December 1942, but only her passenger fittings were removed by the time work was halted in February 1943. She was converted into a [[barracks ship]] in [[Gotenhafen]] and seized by [[Great Britain]] after the end of the war. She remained in use until 1976, when she was broken up for scrap  ==Conversion== Following the loss of the battleship [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] in May 1941, during which British aircraft carriers proved instrumental, and the near torpedoing of her sistership [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] by carrier-launched aircraft in March 1942, the Kriegsmarine became convinced of the necessity of acquiring aircraft carriers.<ref name=GD>Garzke & Dulin, p. 296</ref> Work on the purpose-built carrier [[German aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin|''Graf Zeppelin'']], which had been halted in April 1940, was resumed in March 1942.<ref>Gröner, p. 72</ref> The Kriegsmarine also decided to convert a number of vessels into auxiliary aircraft carriers. Several passenger ships, including ''Gneisenau'', ''Potsdam'', and [[SS Europa (1928)|''Europa'']] were selected for conversion, along with the incomplete [[heavy cruiser]] [[German cruiser Seydlitz|''Seydlitz'']].<ref name=GD/> ''Gneisenau'' and ''Potsdam'' had been built in the mid-1930s and operated by [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] on its East Asia Service until the outbreak of war, when they were requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine as troopships.<ref name=G/>  The ships were found to have insufficient stability when converted into aircraft carriers. This was to have been remedied by the addition of side bulges and fixed ballast. The ballast was to have consisted of "concrete armor," a layer of concrete fitted to the sides of the hulls below the waterline. Conversion work on ''Gneisenau'', which was to be renamed ''Jade'', never began. The project was abandoned on 25 November 1942. The design for ''Potsdam'', which was assigned the name ''Elbe'', was reworked to correct the stability problems. The bulges and concrete armor were discarded and a second outer skin was substituted. Work began on the ship in December 1942; only the ship's passenger fittings were removed by the time work was halted on 2 February 1943.<ref name=G/> This was due to the resignation of Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], the commander in chief of the Kriegsmarine, the previous month.<ref name=GD/> Raeder had resigned in protest of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s order that all surface ships be decommissioned and scrapped in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Barents Sea]].<ref>Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 221</ref>  ''Gneisenau'' was returned to troopship duties after the project was abandoned, but at 12:02 on 2 May 1943, she was sunk by a [[naval mine|mine]] off [[Gedser]]. ''Potsdam'' was converted into a [[barracks ship]] in [[Gotenhafen]], where she spent the remainder of the war. Following the German defeat, the ship was seized by the British on 20 June 1946 as a [[war prize]], who commissioned her as a troop transport under the name [[List of Empire ships (F)#Empire Fowey|''Empire Fowey'']]. She was sold to Pakistan, who operated her under the name ''Safina-E-Hujjaj'' until she was broken up for scrap in 1976.<ref name=G/>  ===Characteristics=== ''Jade'' was {{convert|191|m|sp=us}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|203|m|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]].

If anyone can even be said to rule in Chronias, that being would be Zaphkiel. Zaphkiel is the mysterious ruler of the Hebdomad, and is the only one who has held his position since it was created; all other previous members having perished in combating fiends or gone on to join the essence of their planes. Zaphkiel embodies the "perfect good," and only the most righteous and exalted individuals can stand in his presence without being consumed. Zaphkiel is the patron of dead children and stillborn babies and watches over their spirits. Beyond this Zaphkiel's motivations and plans are unknowable, though it is known that he intends to make the planes as good as they can be, and only he can promote an archon into the Hebdomad.  ==References== {{reflist}}  {{D&D topics}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Zaphkiel (Dungeons and Dragons)}} [[Category:Dungeons & Dragons extraplanar creatures]]   {{D&D-char-stub}}</text></page>",

Carson began her career as a biologist in the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Bureau of Fisheries]], and became a full-time nature writer in the 1950s.  Her widely praised 1951 bestseller ''[[The Sea Around Us]]'' won her financial security and recognition as a gifted writer.  Her next book, ''[[The Edge of the Sea]]'', and the republished version of her first book, ''[[Under the Sea Wind]]'', were also bestsellers.  Together, her sea trilogy explores the whole of [[ocean]] life, from the shores to the surface to the deep sea.  In early 1953, Carson began library and field research on the [[ecology]] and [[organism]]s of the Atlantic shore. In 1955, she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy, ''[[The Edge of the Sea]]'', which focuses on life in [[coastal]] [[ecosystem]]s (particularly along the [[Eastern Seaboard]]). It appeared in ''The New Yorker'' in two condensed installments shortly before the October 26 book release. By this time, Carson's reputation for clear and poetical prose was well established; ''The Edge of the Sea'' received highly favorable reviews, if not quite as enthusiastic as for ''The Sea Around Us''.  Starting in the mid-1940s, Carson had become concerned about the use of synthetic pesticides, many of which had been developed through the [[military funding of science]] since [[World War II]].  It was the USDA's 1957 fire ant eradication program, however, that prompted Carson to devote her research, and her next book, to pesticides and environmental poisons.  The [[fire ant]] program involved aerial spraying of [[DDT]] and other pesticides (mixed with [[fuel oil]]), including the spraying of private land.  Landowners in Long Island filed a suit to have the spraying stopped, and many in affected regions followed the case closely. Though the suit was lost, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future; this laid the basis for later successful environmental actions.  ''[[Silent Spring]]'' was written by Rachel Carson and published by [[Houghton Mifflin]] on 27 September 1962. The book is widely credited with helping launch the [[environmental movement]].  | link    =  Rachel Carson | page    = biographies | archive = }}</text></page>",

A site atop a {{convert|175|ft|adj=on}} cliff was chosen for the light, and construction commenced in 1856 on the first lighthouse located here; the light was put into service with a fourth-order [[Fresnel lens]] later that year.<ref name = "pepper"/>  However, due to the poor quality of materials used in construction, the condition of the building deteriorated rapidly, and by 1865 the light was judged to be in "wretched condition."<ref name = "pepper"/>  A replacement was recommended, and Congress appropriated more money the following year.  In 1867, the second Grand Island North Light Station was built.  This was before the founding of nearby Munising, or indeed the before the establishment of the surrounding county of Alger.<ref name = "state"/> The light house was built of brick, using standard plans provided by the U.S. Lighthouse Establishment. The lens was transferred from the old tower, and the light was put into service the same year.<ref name = "pepper"/>  A keeper and an assistant were stationed at the lighthouse; over the years a few minor changes were made to the boathouse location and associated stairs.  In 1941, the lamp was automated and the station was boarded up and abandoned.<ref name = "pepper"/> In 1961, a 12-volt electrical system was installed on a pole near the cliff, the earlier light was decommissioned, and the Fresnel lens removed.<ref name = "pepper"/>  The station, now surplus, was sold to [[Loren Graham]].<ref name = "pepper"/> Restoration work was done in 1972 - 1973.<ref name = "state"/> The lighthouse and associated buildings are currently used as a private summer home.<ref name = "state"/>  ==Description== The Grand Island North Light Station is a two-story building constructed of brick in a rectangular plan.  A three-story, {{convert|40|ft|adj=on}} light tower and a one-story kitchen addition are attached to the station. The station has a tin-covered gable roof supported by queen-post trusses. The exterior is painted in the original colors of yellow, white, and black, and the station as a whole looks substantially as it did when built. The tower once housed a fourth-order Fresnal lens.<ref name = "state"/>  Four other buildings are located on the site: a tool shed, fuel storage shed, and outhouse (all made of brick); and a wooden well-house.<ref name = "state"/>  ==See also== * [[Lighthouses in the United States]]  ==References== {{reflist}}  {{Lighthouses of Michigan}} {{National Register of Historic Places}}  [[Category:Lighthouses completed in 1867]] [[Category:Houses completed in 1867]] [[Category:Towers completed in 1867]] [[Category:Lighthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan]] [[Category:Lighthouses in Alger County, Michigan]]</text></page>",

The neighborhood is located in the southeast section of Baltimore city and borders the 137 acre park of the same name on the north and east sides. Patterson Park is traditionally centered on the intersection of Baltimore Street and Linwood Avenue and until the formation of Patterson Park Neighborhood Association in 1986 was referred to as the Baltimore-Linwood Neighborhood. The original borders of Patterson Park neighborhood were Pratt Street to the south, Fayette Street to the north, Milton Street to the west and Clinton Street to the east, but in 2011 the Patterson Park Neighborhood Association voted to expand the northern border to Orleans Street between Milton and Curley Street.  Roughly two miles east of [[Downtown Baltimore|Baltimore's downtown district]], Patterson Park is near the neighborhoods of [[Butchers Hill, Baltimore|Butchers Hill]], [[Canton, Maryland|Canton]], [[Fells Point]], [[Highlandtown, Baltimore|Highlandtown]], and [[McElderry Park, Baltimore|McElderry Park]].  ==History==  ===Founding=== Patterson Park homes were first developed between the mid-19th century and early 20th century to accommodate the swelling population of Baltimore City after the Civil War.  [[William Patterson (Maryland)|William Patterson]] owned much of the land that now constitutes the Patterson Park neighborhood. In 1827, he donated 5 acres of land in what we now know as [[Patterson Park, Baltimore|Patterson Park]] to the city for a public walk. His heirs were less interested in donating the land that remained; and instead leased the land to speculative builders, who then raised rowhouses on it. The builders sold these homes at a profit, while the Patterson heirs collected [[ground rent]] on the leased land.<ref name="Patterson Park Neighbors">[http://www.pattersonparkneighbors.org/history/index.html Origins] Origins of Patterson Park. Retrieved 2011-09-26</ref>  Affectionately known as "marble houses," the typical Patterson Park rowhouse was built in [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival]], or Italianate, style. They have restrained flat roofs; flat, brown or red brick façades; molded and galvanized sheet-metal exterior cornices, often stamped with neoclassical decoration and dressed up with ball finials; stained glass transoms; and marble steps and trim.  In the latter half of the 19th century, immigrant European laborers as well as free blacks like [[Frederick Douglass]] flocked to Baltimore seeking jobs in the waterfront factories, rail yards and wharves. The architect-designed homes of Bolton Hill and Mount Vernon were beyond their reach, but speculative builders built block upon block of narrow [[Terraced house|rowhouses]] on inexpensive land, including around Patterson Park.  Architectural details changed over time, as building and manufacturing process advanced. For example, when plate glass became affordable in the late 1890s, builders replaced the tall, narrow Palladian first floor windows with a single, wide plate glass window—some arched, some square.  Three-story Victorians built circa 1900 to 1910 line the park's border. Two-story rowhomes dating from the 1920s line quaint and narrow side streets, some still paved with brick. Interiors often feature pressed tin ceilings, hardwood floors, stained glass windows and ornate moldings. Many houses still have original marble steps.  By 1927, many of the immigrants were from [[Bohemia]], thanks to the growth of the [[History of the Czechs in Baltimore|Czech]] population in nearby [[East Monument Historic District|Little Bohemia]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Baltimore's Patterson Park|last= Almaguer|first= Tim|authorlink= |year= 2006|publisher= [[Arcadia Publishing]]|location= Mount Pleasant, South Carolina|isbn= 0-7385-4365-9|page= 81|pages= |accessdate=August 28, 2012 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yYDTFqpImgUC&pg=PA81&lpg=PA81&dq=Baltimore+Telegraf+Czech&source=bl&ots=lPAjB251jj&sig=uKg5oO_f8c192Q8Fxj1KgBTg-5M&hl=en&sa=X&ei=IhY9UJLZCcXF6wGwrYDoBg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>  ===Decline=== The exodus of middle-class—and aspiring middle-class—whites from the city center is not unique to the Patterson Park community. This is a characteristically American settlement pattern, stimulated by the advent of the electric trolley (streetcar) in 1888, and accelerated by social and economic transitions since then.  The fabric of Southeast Baltimore's working class communities was woven from the availability of good blue-collar jobs in the manufacturing industries surrounding the waterfront. Plant closures, layoffs, and the general decline of the manufacturing sector began to weaken that fabric in the 1960s.  Changes in the city's demographic composition fed fears and prejudice among residents who were suffering economic hardships. Profound social shifts arising from the civil rights movement strengthened the case for elimination of residential housing segregation, but the unintended consequence was white flight. Absentee landlords, property abandonment, predatory lending and property flipping fed the decline in Baltimore's downtown communities.  Concerted efforts by the city's political and business establishment began to focus on downtown redevelopment in the 1970s. Such efforts slowed but did not halt housing abandonment and disinvestment in Southeast Baltimore in general, and Patterson Park in particular.  The mid-1990s were a particularly difficult time for Patterson Park, as nearby public housing estates were shut down abruptly, leaving nearby residents looking for housing options. Absentee landlords in the Patterson Park neighborhood took advantage of the new transient population. The stresses further weakened the neighborhood.  ===Revitalization===  ====Patterson Park Community Development Corporation==== In 1996, the Patterson Park Community Development Corporation (PPCDC) was created to increase ownership rates and decreased vacancies in the area. Founder Ed Rutkowski had created the Patterson Park Neighborhood Initiative, hiring organizers to gather neighbors to define the issues affecting their neighborhoods including crime, less-than-robust city services and nuisances. Between 1996 and 2009, the PPCDC renovated about 300 Patterson Park rowhomes, many vacant. Since 1996, the area's vacancy rate declined from nearly twice that of the rest of Baltimore City to less than the average, the crime rate has dropped to less than half for violent offenses, and the average housing value has nearly tripled.  In February 2009, the collapse of the housing market led the PPCDC to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.<ref name="Community Development Corporation">[http://www.abell.org/programareas/highlights/patterson2.html Patterson Park Community Development Corporation] Abell Foundation Patterson Park Community Development Corporation.

Founded to encourage city residents to be involved in community activities, PPNA has 300 active members.<ref name="About PPNA">[http://www.pattersonparkneighbors.org/about/index.html] About Patterson Park Neighbors Retrieved 2011-09-27</ref> The PPNA encourages neighborliness and foster resident volunteerism. The Association holds a monthly community meeting in a local church basement, and organizes block clean-ups, tree and flower plantings, holiday parties, pot lucks, home tours and block parties.  ====Leadership==== PPNA leadership consists of an elected board, one president, four vice presidents, one treasurer, and one secretary. The vice presidents each represent one sector of PPNA: North, South, East and West Sectors with the dividing line of the sectors generally being Linwood Avenue and Baltimore Street. Elections take place every January and every seat is voted on during elections. Officeholders must live within Patterson Park borders and be a paying PPNA member.  ====Greening Committee==== In a partnership with the Baltimore Neighborhood Energy Challenge, the PPNA Greening Committee is working to reduce the energy consumption of Baltimore by educating and encouraging residents to pledge to reduce their household energy use through efficiency. The Greening Committee has also been awarded over $60,000 in donations to finance its project, including major support from the Chesapeake Bay Trust, a state-chartered grant maker, and Healthy Neighborhoods Inc., a local nonprofit for tree plantings in the neighborhood.<ref name="Neighbors plant trees, good feelings in East Baltimore">[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-12-11/news/bs-md-ci-patterson-park-trees-20101210_1_tree-canopy-new-trees-free-trees] Patterson Park Tree Plantings Retrieved 2011-09-27</ref>  ====Alley gating==== In 2010, PPNA has fostered gated alleys: residents gate both ends of an alley and make it a park-like space for neighbors to enjoy.<ref name="A new life for Baltimore alleys">[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/gallery/2010/05/26/GA2010052602989.html] Baltimore Gated Alleys Retrieved 2011-09-27</ref>  ==Boundaries and Population== Patterson Park is bounded by Baltimore Street to the south, Patterson Park Avenue to the west, Orleans Street to the north, and Linwood Avenue to the east.

These are paltry numbers for a neologism article). The article further has little to no actual content, not covered by, say, [[anti-vaccination]] or similar. The article itself admits that it's poorly-defined. Further, while claiming to be a separate term from anti-vaccinationist, many of the people who are supposedly separate from the anti-vaccination movement are, in fact, the ''leading lights'' of the anti-vaccination movement, which makes the distinction extremely dubious. Probably Original research.   Long story short, there is no evidence this term has any notability as a distinct term, nor that it has ever been consistently used (and it's not been used very much!) to make the distinction the article wishes to draw. I'll buy that someone, somewhere, might have tried to make the distinction - but it hasn't caught on, and I can find no evidence that anyone accepts this definiton.  [[Nonce words]] are words that are created for a very specific purpose, that are unlikely to come up again. For instance, one muight create the unlikely term dechickenization in your story about a mad scientist who stuck the hero's brain in a chicken. It wouldn't appear in a dictionary, but the meaning is clear.

The head office is situated in [[Fredrikstad]]. Jøtul AS is also the parent company in the Jøtul Group, with subsidiaries in the [[USA]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Poland]].  ==History== Jøtul was founded by [[Oluf Onsum]] as '''Kværner Jernstøberi''' (''Kværner Foundry'') in the outskirts of Christiania (now [[Oslo]]) in 1853. While stoves initially were the main products, the company had diversified by the beginning of the 20th century, when it produced [[turbine]]s and lumber equipment. As the heating appliance manufacture decreased in importance, the production was spun off in 1916 and sold to Herman Anker, one of Kværner's managers. He founded Jøtul AS in 1920 as a sales organization for its products. The sales stagnated during the [[Great Depression|depression]] in the 1920s, and 36 year old Herman Anker died in 1927, leaving it to his successor, 34 year old Johannes Gahr to modernize and eventually salvage the company. By 1935, the turnaround had succeeded, and the firm acquired its modern name.  By the 1960s, stoves using liquid fuels, especially [[kerosene]] had supplanted wood burning appliances, a trend that was only reversed in the 1970s, partly due to the [[1973 oil crisis]]. Jøtul used this opportunity to gain a strong international foothold and drastically increased its exports to continental [[Europe]] and [[North America]].  The Gahr family sold the business to [[Norcem]] in 1977, and a period of international expansion began, as Jøtul acquired a number of foundries and importers abroad. This period lasted for approximately ten years, but came to an end during the recession in the late 1980s, when Jøtul once again focussed on the domestic market. However, it has resumed its international diversification in the 21st century, and today its products are sold worldwide.  Jøtul is now owned by the private equity companies [[Ratos]] and [[Accent Equity Partners]], plus the management of the Jøtul Group.<ref name="History">{{cite web | url        = http://www.jotul.com/wwwjotulno/Main-Menu/Om-Jotul/Bedriftsinformasjon/Historikk/ | title      = Historikk | publisher  = Jøtul AS | accessdate = 2011-10-17 | language   = Norwegian }}</ref>  ==Products and markets== The Jøtul Group sells and markets its products under the brands ''Jøtul, Scan, Atra, Ild, Warm, Jøtul Group Accessories'' and ''Jøtul Group Chimney System'' throughout North and [[South America]], Europe, [[South Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Oceania]].<ref name="Homepage">{{cite web | url        = http://www.jotul.com/wwwjotulcom/ | title      = International homepage | publisher  = Jøtul AS | accessdate = 2011-10-17 }}</ref>  Jøtul products have received several design awards from both the [[Norwegian Design Council]]<ref>{{cite web | url        = http://www.norskdesign.no/search-category/category169.html?categoryID=169&articlesearchstring=J%C3%B8tul | title      = Search result: Jøtul design awards | publisher  = [[Norwegian Design Council]] | accessdate = 2011-10-17 }}</ref> and [[Red Dot|Red dot design awards]].<ref>{{cite web | url        = http://en.red-dot.org/2858.html?&cHash=2bd372ef64e9cb54b7d1d09934cf2140&detail=7608 | title      = Red Dot design products awards 2011: Jøtul F 162 & 163 Stoves | publisher  = [[Red Dot]] | accessdate = 2011-10-17 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url        = http://en.red-dot.org/2858.html?&cHash=1777e62b299a734fcbb65a092ae03a8d&detail=3670 | title      = Red Dot design products awards 2007: Jøtul 373 wood burning stove | publisher  = [[Red Dot]] | accessdate = 2011-10-17 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url        = http://en.red-dot.org/2243.html | title      = The best designers of the red dot design award 2007 in interview: Anna Oeren | publisher  = [[Red Dot]] | accessdate = 2011-10-17 }}</ref>  ==References== {{reflist}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Jotul}} [[Category:HVAC manufacturing companies]] [[Category:Norwegian brands]] [[Category:Companies established in 1853]] [[Category:1853 establishments in Norway]] [[Category:Manufacturing companies of Norway]] [[Category:Engineering companies of Norway]] [[Category:Companies based in Østfold]]</text></page>",

The Residence, whose buildings are now part of [[Chernivtsi University]], was declared a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 2011.  ==Construction== In 1782, following the incorporation of Bukovina into the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], the seat of the [[Metropolis of Moldavia and Bukovina|Moldavian Eastern Orthodox]] Bishops of [[Rădăuți]] was moved to Chernivtsi (then known as Czernowitz). The province's military administration built a residence in haste for bishop [[Dositei Herescu]]. The edifice, completed in 1783, bore a shabby aspect, divided as it was into small, low rooms, with a little chapel that had a brick floor. Due to fungal growth caused by humidity, part of the building collapsed in 1790 and the rest was demolished. Thus, Herescu and his successors [[Daniil Vlahovici]], [[Isaia Baloșescu]] and, for a time, [[Eugenie Hacman]], were obliged to move around rented rooms. In 1851-1852, Hacman sent a series of reports to the administration in [[Lviv]], complaining that this situation was undignified. In 1860, the Religious Affairs Ministry issued a decree announcing a contest to select an architect for a new episcopal residence. The [[Czechs|Czech]] architect Josef Hlávka was selected to develop the project.<ref>Luceac (2008) 79.</ref><ref>Chuchko (2012) 11.</ref>  In preparing his designs, Hlávka researched the building traditions of the region, and published an article, "Buildings of the Eastern Greek Church in Bukovina", in the ''Austrian Review'' in 1866.<ref>Chuchko (2012) 14.</ref> Hlávka's proposals for the complex included not only the bishop's palace but also administrative offices, meeting halls, a library, a choir school, a museum of church art and a chapel.<ref>Chuchko (2012) 20-21.</ref> The resulting work combines [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] style, with the [[Alhambra]] as one inspiration.<ref>Luceac (2008) 80.</ref>  Construction commenced in 1864<ref>Chuchko (2012) 26.</ref> but was subjected to substantial delays due to technical problems, the illness of Hlávka from 1872 onwards, and to disagreements between Hlávka and  the local administration, which led to Hlávka's resignation.<ref>Chuchko (2012) 44-8.</ref> The incompetence of Hlávka's successor, Feliks Ksiezarski, further delayed progress.<ref>Chuchko (2012) 50.</ref> The building and churches were consecrated in the winter of 1882/3.<ref>Chuchko (2012) 74.</ref>  ==Significance== The UNESCO citation, declaring the Residence and the buildings in its complex as of "outstanding universal value", describes the site as follows:<blockquote>The architectural ensemble comprises the former Residence of the Metropolitans with its St. Ivan of [[Suceava]] Chapel; the former [[seminary]] and Seminary Church, and the former [[monastery]] with its clock tower within a garden and landscaped park. The Residence, with a dramatic fusion of architectural references, expresses the 19th century cultural identity of the Orthodox Church within the Austro-Hungarian Empire during a period of religious and cultural toleration. In the 19th century, [[historicism|historicist]] architecture could convey messages about its purpose and the Residence of Bukovinian and Dalmatian Metropolitans is an excellent example.<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1330 Residence of Bukovinian and Dalmatian Metropolitans] on the UNESCO  website, accessed 14 May 2013</ref></blockquote>  ==Features== The buildings of the complex are laid out on three sides of a courtyard which is approximately 100 metres deep and 70 metres wide:<ref>UNESCO (2011), 331.</ref> the fourth side of this yard contains the main gates, set in tall railings.  Opposite the gate is the largest single building, the residence of the Metropolitan, which also contains the Chapel of [[John the New of Suceava]].

Initially Bulgaria was to deliver 20,000 Jews to the Germans. The plan's first step called for the "purification" of the Bulgarian occupied territories of Thrace and Macedonia. In March 1943, Bulgarian police rounded up the Jews of Thrace and Macedonia at night and placed them in detention camps under extremely harsh conditions. Their property and their houses were confiscated prior to their deportation in the later part of the month. Sealed trains transported 11,384 Jews, mainly via the Danube River, to death camps, from which almost none returned.

With the war raging around their borders, the Macedonians remain cocooned in their world of patriotic pleasures, primarily concerned about getting the beleaguered Macedonia Football Club on a winning streak. Their manager hires the legendary German-Jewish coach Rudolph Spitz to turn them into champions. But when the Nazi occupation begins and they start deporting Jews, Kosta and his teammates realize that the carefree days of their youth are over. As the Nazis try to sabotage the outcome of the championship game, and Spitz's life is threatened, Kosta and his teammates rise to the challenge to protect their coach, with all of Macedonia cheering them on.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_third_half/ Rotten Tomatoes]</ref>  ==Cast== *[[Sasko Kocev]] as Kosta *[[Katarina Ivanovska]] as Rebecca Cohen **[[Bedija Begovska]] as Rebecca in 2012 *[[Richard Sammel]] as Rudolph Spitz, a Prussian footballer-turned-coach hired to coach FC Macedonia *[[Rade Šerbedžija]] as Don Rafael Cohen, a wealthy Jewish banker and Rebecca's father *[[Emil Ruben]] as Garvanov, a Bulgarian colonel *[[Mitko S.

This means that the term is used in the following way: "the master...affranchises the slave".<ref>{{cite book |title=  Letters on Ancient and Modern History |author =[[John Bigland|Bigland, John]] |year=1808 |publisher= (via [[Google Books]]) |location= |isbn= |page=224 |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=MLcvAAAAYAAJ&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate= February 12, 2012}}</ref>  ==Evolution== ''A History of Ancient Greece'' explains that in the context of [[Ancient Greece]], affranchisement came in many forms. A master choosing to free his slave would most likely only do it "at his death, specifying his desire in his will". In rare cases, slaves who were able to earn enough money through labour were able to buy their own freedom. They were known as ''choris oikointes''. Two 4th-century bankers, [[Pasion]] and [[Phormio]], used to be slaves before they bought their freedom. A slave could also be sold fictitiously to a [[sanctuary]], from where a god could enfranchise him. In very rare circumstances, the city could affranchise a slave. A notable example of this is when [[Athens]] liberated everyone who was present at the [[Battle of Arginusae]] in 406BC. Even once a slave was affranchised, there would still be ties between him (who became a [[metic]]) and his master (who became a [[prostatès]]).<ref>{{cite book |title=  A History of Ancient Greece |author = [[Claude Orrieux|Orrieux, Claude]]; [[Pauline Schmitt Pantel|Pantel, Pauline Schmitt]] |year=1999 |publisher= [[Presses Universitaires de France]] (via [[Google Books]]) |location= |isbn=0-631-20308-7 |page=187 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=b8cA8hymTw8C&lpg=PA188&dq=Affranchise&pg=PA183#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate= February 12, 2012}}</ref>  ==Modern usage== * In his book ''The Uprising of a Great People'', author [[Agenor Gasparin]] ([[Mary Louise Booth|Mary Booth]], translator) uses the term affranchisement in the context of the American freedom movement from the [[British Empire]].<ref name="Gasp">{{cite book |title = The Uprising of a Great People |last= Gasparin |first= Agenor |authorlink=Agenor Gasparin|others = [[Mary Louise Booth]], translator |year=1862 |publisher= [[Applewood Books]] (via [[Google Books]]) |location= |isbn=|page=28 |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=mqpK-tY-ow0C&lpg=PA35&vq=affranchisement&pg=PA35#v=snippet&q=affranchisement&f=false|accessdate= February 12, 2012}}</ref>  * According to ''[[The European Magazine, and London Review]]'', volume 44, in the sixth volume of her book ''Memoirs of Illustrious and Celebrated Women, of All Ages and Countries'', [[Mary Hays]] uses the term affranchisement to denote the willingness of French nobility to free their [[vassal]]s in the chapter dealing with [[Catherine the Great]].<ref name="mary">(1803).
